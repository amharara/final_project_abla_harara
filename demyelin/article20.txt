The brain is very sensitive to changes in redox status; thus maintaining redox homeostasis in the brain is
critical for the prevention of accumulating oxidative damage. Aging is the primary risk factor for de-
veloping neurodegenerative diseases. In addition to age, genetic and environmental risk factors have also
been associated with disease development. The primary reactive insults associated with the aging pro-
cess are a result of oxidative stress (OS) and nitrosative stress (NS). Markers of increased oxidative stress,
protein and DNA modiﬁcation, inﬂammation, and dysfunctional proteostasis have all been implicated in
contributing to the progression of neurodegeneration. The ability of the cell to combat OS/NS and
maintain a clearance mechanism for misfolded aggregating proteins determines whether or not it will
survive. A critical pathway in this regard is the Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2)- anti-
oxidant response element (ARE) pathway. Nrf2 activation has been shown to mitigate a number of pa-
thologic mechanisms associated with Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, and multiple sclerosis. This review will focus on the role of Nrf2 in these
diseases and the potential for Nrf2 activation to attenuate disease progression.

Introduction

1.1. OS/NS in neurodegenerative diseases

The brain is very sensitive to changes in redox status; thus
maintaining redox homeostasis in the brain is critical for the
prevention of accumulating oxidative damage. Aging is the pri-
mary risk factor for developing neurodegenerative diseases. In
addition to age, genetic and environmental risk factors have also
been associated with disease development. The primary reactive
insults associated with the aging process are a result of oxidative
stress (OS) and nitrosative stress (NS). OS/NS are produced en-
dogenously via enzymatic and spontaneous reactions through a
variety of sources and normal physiological functions [1, 2].

Downstream markers of OS/NS have been identiﬁed clearly in
all neurodegenerative diseases. Signs of lipid peroxidation, such as
aldehydes including 4-hydroxynonenol (4-HNE), are increased in
Parkinson’s disease (PD) [3–5], Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [6–8], and
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [9, 10]. There is also a correla-
tion between the affected brain regions and 4-HNE adducted
proteins [11–13]. Another major marker of OS production is pro-
tein carbonyls, representing protein oxidation. Carbonyls are pre-
sent in the substantia nigra (SN) in PD [14, 15], AD [16], and ALS
[17] and in affected brain regions in other diseases [18–21]. Oxi-
dative damage to DNA/RNA has been evaluated by measuring
8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHDG) and is increased in cen-
tral and peripheral nervous systems of patients with neurode-
generative diseases [22–30]. Post-translational modiﬁcation pro-
teins modify protein structure and function. Protein structure and
function can be altered by phosphorylation, nitration, ubiquitina-
tion, and glycosylation. Such modiﬁcations have been observed in
alpha-synuclein (SYN) in patients with synucleinopathies includ-
ing PD and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) [31–33]. Nitration
and phosphorylation of tau protein has been found in the hippo-
campus and neocortex of patients with AD and other tau pathol-
ogies [34, 35]. Nitrotyrosine-modiﬁed proteins are elevated eight-
fold in the hippocampus and neocortex of AD brains [36, 37].
These region-speciﬁc protein modiﬁcations correlate with areas of
increased OS/NS in the brain. Furthermore, such modiﬁcations are
thought to contribute to protein misfolding and subsequent ag-
gregate/inclusion formation. Because most neurodegenerative
diseases have characteristic misfolded protein aggregates, such as
SYN in PD, beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and hyperphosphorylated
tau neuroﬁbrillary tangles (NFTs) in AD, huntingtin (Htt) in Hun-
tington’s disease (HD), and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) in ALS,
protein aggregation and regulation of misfolded protein clearance
by the proteasome and autophagy appear
to
pathogenesis.

to be vital

1.2. Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway

One of the primary endogenous sources of OS is the mi-
tochondrial electron transport chain.
Increased mitochondrial
dysfunction associated with neurodegenerative diseases leads to
increased OS generation and reduction in the production of ATP. In
addition and associated with neuroinﬂammation, the enzymes of
the NADPH oxidase system generate superoxide anions. The
combination of superoxide anion with nitric oxide, produced by

nitric oxide synthase, generates the highly reactive NS peroxyni-
trite. Combating OS/NS is dependent upon the cell’s ability to
maintain cellular redox homeostasis. A critical pathway in this
regard is the Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2)-
antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway. The ARE is an en-
hancer element having the consensus sequence RTGACnnnGC,
which is located in the 5’ ﬂanking region of many phase II de-
toxifying and antioxidant genes [38, 39]. Nrf2 is a cytoplasmic
protein sequestered by the actin-bound protein Keap1 (Kelch ECH
associating protein) [40, 41]. Keap1, a Cul3-based E3 ligase, poly-
ubiquitinates Nrf2, targeting it for subsequent proteasomal de-
gradation [42, 43]. Oxidative stress or exposure to electrophilic
agents that react with Keap1 stabilize Nrf2, leading to increased
Nrf2 protein levels and nuclear accumulation of Nrf2. Once in the
nucleus, Nrf2 dimerizes with small Maf proteins and binds to the
ARE, transcriptionally driving expression of several detoxifying
and antioxidant genes [44, 45].

Nrf2 contains six well-conserved Nrf2-ECH homologous (Neh)
domains that support molecular functions. The CNC (cap’n’ collar)
and DNA binding regions are located in the Neh1 domain, as is the
Maf dimerization site. Neh4 and Neh5 are necessary for recruit-
ment of transcription factors and other canonical proteins required
for gene expression [46]. Molecular studies have determined that
the Neh2 domain is required for the cytoplasmic localization of
Nrf2, because deletion of Neh2 leads to continuous nuclear
translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus. Yeast two-hydridization
screening using the Neh2 domain from Nrf2 as bait identiﬁed
Keap1 as an Nrf2 binding protein. Eighty percent of the in-
dependently isolated clones screened were Keap1 positive, sug-
gesting speciﬁcity of the Keap1–Nrf2 interaction [40]. Keap1 has
two canonical domains, the Kelch domain and the bric-a-brac,
tramtrack, broad-complex (BTB) domain. The Kelch domain binds
actin and thus tethers the Keap1–Nrf2 complex to the cytoskele-
ton. The BTB domain is important for protein dimerization of
Keap1 molecules. There are many cysteine residues in the Keap1
protein that potentially function as sensors of oxidants and elec-
trophiles; humans have 27 and rat and mouse have 25 [44, 47].
The “hinge and latch” model proposes that two Keap1 molecules
bind Nrf2 at high- and low-afﬁnity sites located in the Neh2 do-
main [48]. The hinge domain, EGTE, supports high afﬁnity and the
latch domain, DLG, low afﬁnity. When Keap1 senses oxidative or
electrophilic stress, the low-afﬁnity domain binding Nrf2 is abol-
ished and proteosomal degradation of Nrf2 is disrupted [49]. In
addition to Keap1, Nrf2 turnover can be regulated by GSK3β/β-
TrCP- and Hrd1-dependent mechanisms in different pathological
states [50, 51]. GSK3β phosphorylates the Neh6 domain of Nrf2.
This facilitates binding of the β-TrCP/Cul1 E3 ligase complex to
Nrf2. Nrf2 is then ubiquitinated and degraded through β-TrCP-
mediated proteasomal degradation. Hrd1 is another E3 ubiquitin
ligase that resides in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Hrd1
directly interacts with Nrf2 at the Neh4-5 domains by binding to
the cytoplasmic C-terminal region of Hrd1, leading to Nrf2 ubi-
quitination and degradation.

In addition, there are endogenous proteins that have been
shown to interact with Keap1 and activate the Nrf2 pathway. An
initial screen using Nrf2-dependent ARE-luciferase activity iden-
tiﬁed seven activating proteins: sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1 or p62),
(DBP),

dipeptidylpeptidase 3 (DPP3), BCL2-like 1 (BCL2L1 or Bcl-xL), the
kinesin family member 26B (KIF26B), cAMP-responsive element
binding protein-regulated transcription coactivator 1 (TORC1),
myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl1), and the splicing factor
arginine/serine-rich 10 (SFRS10) [52]. Subsequently, both SQSTM1
and DPP3 were shown to interact with Keap1 [53, 54]. The Wilms
tumor gene on the X chromosome (WTX) and PALB2, a major
BRCA2 binding partner, also bind to Keap1, whereas p21 directly
binds to Nrf2, leading to inhibition of Nrf2 ubiquitination and in-
creased Nrf2-dependent gene expression [55–57]. This review will
focus on the role of Nrf2 in neurodegeneration and the potential
for Nrf2 activation to mitigate progression of neurological diseases.

2. Nrf2 in Alzheimer’s disease

AD is an age-associated progressive neurodegenerative dis-
order characterized by memory loss and cognitive dysfunction. It
is the most common form of dementia. There are currently over
5 million AD patients in the United States and it is projected that,
without the development of disease-modifying therapies, the
number will increase to approximately 13.8 million by 2050 [58].
Pathological hallmarks of AD include brain atrophy due to neu-
ronal and synapse loss, senile plaques predominantly consisting of
ﬁbrillar amyloid beta (Aβ)-peptide, and neuroﬁbrillary tangles
(NFT) of hyperphosphorylated tau, a cytoskeletal protein. Aβ is
generated from the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by
β- and γ-secretases, and it is believed that small oligomers of this
self-aggregating peptide are responsible for the neuronal cell
death in AD [59]. The major risk factor for developing AD is aging
and most AD is sporadic; however, a small fraction of AD is familial
in origin. Mutations in APP, presenilin 1 (PS1), and presenilin 2 are
associated with early onset familial disease [60]. In addition to the
plaques and NFT, the AD brain is characterized by mitochondrial
dysfunction, reactive gliosis, and oxidative damage to lipids and
proteins [36, 226–229].

2.1. Nrf2 and Nrf2-dependent genes in AD brains

Initial studies demonstrated that NAD(P)H:quinone oxidor-
eductase 1 (NQO1) is increased in AD compared to control tissues
[61–63]. The same was found for glutathione reductase, glu-
tathione peroxidase, and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) [64–66]. In
addition, p62, HO-1, and glutamate cysteine ligase modiﬁer sub-
unit (GCLM) were increased in AD brains [67]. Tanji and colleagues
[67] also demonstrated that Keap1 and p62 interact with each
other and are present in both the soluble and insoluble protein
fractions in AD brain, as well as showing co-localization of Keap1
with NFT. A study that examined Nrf2 via immunohistochemistry
found that Nrf2 is present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of
neurons in normal hippocampi, with greater intensity in the nu-
cleus; however, in AD, Nrf2 was conﬁned to the cytoplasm [68]. In
contrast to the previous studies, this suggests that there is reduced
Nrf2 activation in the AD brain. Indeed, studies have shown that
some of the same Nrf2-dependent genes discussed above are re-
duced or do not change in AD [69–71]. These contradictory ﬁnd-
ings are not surprising and could be very dependent on the stage
of disease at the time of tissue collection. In addition, our la-
boratory has unpublished and published data indicating that the
vast majority of Nrf2-dependent genes and proteins, as well as
glutathione (GSH) levels in the brain and spinal cord, are not de-
creased in Nrf2-/- mice [72, 73].

2.2. Nrf2 and animal models of AD

Multiple papers have demonstrated that Nrf2 activation can

protect against Aβ-mediated toxicity in vitro, so the following
discussion will focus primarily on the in vivo data generated that
support a role Nrf2 in modulating AD. The ﬁrst study to examine
Nrf2 in a mouse model of AD (APP/PS1; APPSwe/PS1ΔE9) demon-
strated a decrease in mRNA levels of GCLM, glutamate cysteine
ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC), and NQO1 at 6 months of age, as
well as a reduction in Nrf2 at 16 months, using im-
munohistochemistry [74]. However, recent work in 7-month-old
APP/PS1 mice did not see any signiﬁcant changes in mRNA levels
of these same genes [73]. At the protein level, there was a modest
but signiﬁcant increase of GCLC with no change in Keap1, NQO1, or
GCLM in the APP/PS1 mice. Studies using the 3xTG model of AD
also found a signiﬁcant increase in NQO1 protein in hippocampus
and cortex at 2 months of age, but by 6 months of age, NQO1 levels
were actually signiﬁcantly reduced in hippocampus [75]. Finally,
nuclear Nrf2 levels were increased at 3 months and decreased at
15 months in the male cortex but unchanged in the female cortex
of 3xTG mice [76]. In spite of these observations, there was no
increase in GCLC and there were decreases in SOD1 (superoxide
dismutase 1), HO-1, and Prdx-1 (peroxiredoxin-1) mRNA in the
3-month-old male 3xTG cortex. Overall, it is hard to argue that
there are consistent changes in protein or mRNA in mouse models
of AD, which is similar to the observations in human tissue.

Nrf2-/- mice crossed with APP/PS1 mice showed signiﬁcant
increases in intracellular Aβ, APP fragments, and full-length APP in
CA1 neurons in APP/PS1/Nrf2-/- compared with APP/PS1 mice,
without a clear change in plaque load [73]. Furthermore, levels of
Aβ, APP fragments, and full-length APP in the insoluble protein
fraction from hippocampus were increased in APP/PS1/Nrf2-/-
mice. It has been suggested that Nrf2 is involved in regulation of
autophagy via increasing p62 [77–79]. Interestingly, the same APP/
PS1/Nrf2-/- had punctate staining patterns for p62 versus a more
diffuse staining in APP/PS1 mice, implying that the lack of Nrf2 in
APP/PS1 mice drives p62 into more insoluble aggregates. There
was an increase in the ratio of phospho-mTOR/total mTOR, as well
as an increase in the ratio of phospho-p70S6k/total p70S6k in
hippocampus of APP/PS1/Nrf2-/- mice compared with littermate
controls,
indicative of autophagy inhibition. More evidence of
autophagy inhibition in APP/PS1/Nrf2-/- mice was the increase in
multivesicular bodies, endosomes, and lysosomes in CA1 neuron
compared with APP/PS1 mice. Jo and co-workers published that
tau and phosphorylated tau increase spontaneously in 6-month-
old Nrf2 knockout mice [80]. Although there was no change in tau
kinase or phosphatase activities in Nrf2-/- mice, there was a sig-
niﬁcant reduction in NDP52 (an autophagy adaptor protein). The
NDP52 promoter contains ARE sequences and is induced by Nrf2
activating compounds that lead to a reduction of phosphorylated
tau. In contrast to these data, Joshi and co-workers [73] found no
increase in tau or phosphorylated tau in either the 7-month-old
Nrf2-/- mice or APP/PS1/Nrf2-/- (unpublished data).

An antisense oligonucleotide approach targeting GSK3β has
been done in the SAMP8 AD model [81]. As mentioned earlier,
Nrf2 turnover can be regulated by the GSK3β/β-TrCP pathway, and
inhibition of GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of Nrf2 would
prevent the binding of β-TrCP and subsequent Nrf2 degradation via
this pathway. The treatment increased nuclear Nrf2 and glu-
tathione s-transferase (GST) levels. This correlated with improved
behavior, reduced nuclear and cytoplasmic GSK3β, reduced protein
carbonyl and protein bound 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), and re-
duced phospho-tau. Lentivirus (LV) was used to deliver Nrf2 in-
trahippocampally in a mouse model of AD [82]. LV-Nrf2 was ste-
reotactically injected bilaterally into the hippocampus of 9-month-
old transgenic APP/PS1 mice. Spatial learning deﬁcits of aged APP/
PS1 mice in a Morris water maze were signiﬁcantly improved by
LV-Nrf2 compared with LV-GFP. There was also a reduction in as-
trocytic but not microglial activation and increased neuronal HO-1

up to 6 months postinjection. Finally, earlier studies in our la-
boratory had demonstrated that Nrf2 activation in astrocytes could
confer protection from oxidative-stress-induced death of neurons
[83, 84]. Based on these observations and to further address the
potential role of astrocytic Nrf2 activation providing neuropro-
tection in neurodegenerative diseases, transgenic mice were gen-
erated that selectively overexpressed Nrf2 in astrocytes [85]. The
glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter was used to drive
Nrf2 expression in astrocytes. These GFAP–Nrf2 mice are currently
being crossed with APP/PS1 and mutant tau mice to determine if
astrocytic Nrf2 activation can mitigate the AD-like pathogenesis in
these mouse models.

Many compounds and natural products have been identiﬁed as
Nrf2 activators. CDDO-methylamide (CDDO-MA) improved mem-
ory and decreased plaques, Aβ(1–42), and markers of oxidative
stress in the Tg19959 mice [86]. Puerarin, a phytoestrogen with
antioxidant properties, was shown to improve the phenotype of
APP/PS1 mice [87]. The effect was attributed to preventing the
activation of GSK3β, thus preventing proteasomal degradation of
Nrf2 through the β-TrCP pathway. Gracilins A and C, Spongionella-
derived compounds shown to activate Nrf2 and have antioxidant
properties, have shown some beneﬁt in 3xTG mice [88]. A number
of recent papers have used what they refer to as an acute model of
AD by directly injecting Aβ(1–40) or Aβ(1–42) into the hippo-
campus. When compounds were administered prior to the injec-
tion of Aβ, beneﬁcial effects were noted for SuHeXiang essential oil
[89], sulforaphane [90, 91], β-hydoxybutyrate [92], orientin [93],
and baicalin [94]. A major caveat to all the studies discussed in this
section is that none of them were done in Nrf2-/- or knockdown
mice to clearly demonstrate that these same compounds require
Nrf2 for their therapeutic effects.

3. Nrf2 in Parkinson’s disease

PD is the most common neurodegenerative movement dis-
order, characterized by motor symptoms such as tremor, brady-
kinesia, posture instability, and rigidity, as well as a number of
nonmotor neuropsychiatric problems [95]. One pathological hall-
mark of PD is the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia
nigra pars compacta (SN), resulting in reduced levels of dopamine
in nerve terminals projecting to the striatum. A second hallmark is
the formation of intracellular inclusions made up primarily of al-
pha-synuclein (SYN) bound to ubiquitin, also referred to as Lewy
bodies (LB) [96–98]. As with AD, the majority of PD cases are
sporadic, with familial cases accounting for about 15% of PD [99].
Numerous genes are associated with familial PD, including SYN,
parkin, leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), PTEN-induced puta-
tive kinase 1 (PINK1), and DJ-1 [100]. Similarly to sporadic and
familial cases of AD, the pathologic hallmarks for PD are present in
both sporadic and most cases of familial cases of PD. Thus, the
familial cases of PD and AD are, for the most part, an accelerated
early onset version of sporadic disease.

3.1. Nrf2 and Nrf2-dependent genes in PD brains

It has been noted that NQO1 is up-regulated in astrocytes,
endothelial cells, and dopaminergic neurons in human PD brain
[101]. A similar pattern is observed with HO-1 and peroxiredoxin
in SN of PD patients [102–104]. Immunostaining for Nrf2 de-
monstrated nuclear localization of Nrf2 in dopaminergic neurons
of PD brains [68]. Oxidative stress has been implicated in PD along
with mitochondrial dysfunction, protein carbonyls, and oxidative
DNA damage in the SN [4, 14, 22]. GSH levels are also reduced in
PD brain [105, 106]. In addition, Keap1 is co-localized with SYN
and p62 in LB of PD brain [67]. A recent study in induced

pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived from PD and control patients
also supports Nrf2 involvement in PD. Neurons differentiated from
the PD iPSC had reduced GSH, increased oxidative stress, increased
Nrf2 activation, and increased NQO1 levels [107].

3.2. Nrf2 and animal models of PD

In the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)
model, Chen and colleagues determined changes in mRNA and
measured NQO1 and hPAP (human placental alkaline phospha-
tase) activity [108]. The ARE-hPAP reporter mice have a 51-base-
pair segment of rat NQO1 promoter containing the core ARE that
was inserted into a TATA-Inr minimal promoter:hPAP reporter
gene construct [109]. The SN had increased hPAP and NQO1 ac-
tivity, as well as increased mRNA levels of Nrf2, NQO1, GCLC,
GCLM, and HO-1 following MPTP [108]. In contrast, hPAP and
NQO1 activity were reduced in striatum, along with decreased
mRNA for Nrf2 and NQO1. GCLC, GCLM, and HO-1 remained un-
changed. Another study found an increase in striatal protein levels
of Nrf2 and increased mRNA amounts for GCLC, GCLM, and HO-1
[110]. Finally, Innamorato et al. showed increases in NQO1, GCLM,
GCLC, and HO-1 protein, as well as HO-1 mRNA level in striatum
[111]. These discrepancies may be due to the method of MPTP
administration. In the ﬁrst study, MPTP (30 mg/kg) was adminis-
tered once a day for ﬁve days, with tissues being harvested seven
days after the last dose [108]. The second study administered
MPTP (4 mg/kg) for 20 days [110] and the third used 30 mg/kg,
once a day, for ﬁve days with tissue being harvested immediately
after the last dose [111]. Others have directly injected MPPþ into
the brain and shown decreased SN levels of Nrf2 and GCLC protein
[112]. Using the same MPPþ method, another group found de-
creased Nrf2 DNA binding, no change in Nrf2 or GCLC, and in-
creased HO-1 protein levels in SN [113]. They also determined that
there was no change in Nrf2 DNA binding, decreased Nrf2 and
GCLC protein, but increased HO-1 protein in striatum. In the
6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) model of PD, only a few studies
could be identiﬁed. One study using ARE-hPAP mice demonstrated
increased Nrf2 activity in striatum seven days following injection
[114]. A second study determined that protein levels of both Keap1
and Nrf2 were decreased in striatum [115]. Obviously, the data are
not consistent and more studies need to be performed to sort out
how the Nrf2 pathway is responding to the toxin models of PD.

In transgenic mouse models of PD, only two papers could be
found that directly investigated how familial protein over-
expression affected the Nrf2 pathway [116, 117]. Gan and co-
workers used the Thy1-hSYNA53T PD mouse model and evaluated
changes at two and six months of age (nonsymptomatic and
symptomatic). Since the synucleinopathy in these mice presents in
spinal cord with motor neuron loss, only the spinal cords were
examined.
In nonsymptomatic mice, signiﬁcant but modest
changes were noted. There was a 15% increase in GCLM, increased
NQO1 (1.5-fold mRNA; 2.6-fold protein), and a 10% increase in
GSH. In symptomatic mice, a trend of reduced GSH that correlated
with a 20–30% reduction in GCLM and GCLC mRNA levels was
observed [116]. These same mice were also crossed with the ARE-
hPAP reporter mice, which demonstrated increased hPAP staining
in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. The second study used mice
with the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) promoter driving hSYNWT for
targeted expression in the dopaminergic neurons [117]. At one
month of age NQO1, GCLM, GCLC, and HO-1 were increased ran-
ging from 1.6- to 2.0-fold in the SN and 2.1- to 2.5-fold in striatum.
However, by the age of six months, all changes returned to control
levels.

Early experiments utilized Nrf2-/- mice to show increased
sensitivity to the dopaminergic toxins MPTP and 6-OHDA [118,
119]. The increased sensitivity of the Nrf2-/- mice to MPTP has

D.A. Johnson, J.A. Johnson / Free Radical Biology and Medicine 88 (2015) 253–267

257

been repeated in multiple laboratories [108, 111, 120–122]. In
general, there is a greater loss of TH and reduction of dopamine
(DA), as well as
the dopamine metabolites 3,4-dihydrox-
yphenylaceticacid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA). There is
increased neuroinﬂammation associated with greater astrocyte
(GFAP) and microglial (Iba-1; ionized calcium binding adaptor
molecule 1) activation in Nrf2-/- mice. It is also important to note
that the basal level of mRNA expression and protein content of
Nrf2-dependent genes remained unchanged [108, 121] or slightly
reduced [122] in striatum and SN (ventral midbrain) of the Nrf2-/-
compared to control mice. This strongly suggests that the primary
role for Nrf2 in the central nervous system is to respond to insults
by activation of gene expression. Thus, the lack of an Nrf2 response
in Nrf2-/- mice leads to greater damage in the mouse brain. In-
terestingly, it is hypothesized that Nrf2 responsiveness is atte-
nuated with age, reducing the endogenous Nrf2 response to oxi-
dative stress similarly to what is most likely occurring in the
Nrf2-/- mice.

Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has been used to deliver hSYNWT
(AAV-hSYNWT) to Nrf2þ/þ and Nrf2-/- mice [123]. AAV-hSYNWT
was stereotactically injected into the ventral midbrain and tissues
were harvested 2 months after injection. There was a small but
signiﬁcant loss of TH-positive neurons in both Nrf2þ/þ and
Nrf2-/-, with slightly more loss (23% more) in the Nrf2-/- mice.
However, there were no changes in DA, DOPAC, or HVA. The au-
thors speculate that the Nrf2 pathway may be involved in SYN
degradation through the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) but
the mRNA levels of the proteasome subunits PSMB7, PSMC3, and
PSMC4 in the ventral midbrain were not signiﬁcantly different
between Nrf2þ/þ and Nrf2-/- mice. Immunohistochemical ana-
lysis for PSMB7 allowed evaluation of the dopaminergic neurons,
which stained positive for hSYNWT and PSMB7. These data did
suggest that there are differences in neuronal PSMB7 in Nrf2þ/þ
and Nrf2-/- mice. There were also changes in astrocytic and mi-
croglial activation based on cellular morphology without bio-
chemical validation.

Based on early studies showing the importance of Nrf2 acti-
vation in astrocytes [83, 84], Jakel and co-workers transduced
astrocytes in vitro with adenovirus containing Nrf2 (Ad-Nrf2) or
GFP (Ad-GFP) and then transplanted these Nrf2-overexpressing
and control GFP astrocytes into the ipsilateral and contralateral
striatum, respectively, by stereotactic injection [119]. Five weeks
later, bilateral injection 6-OHDA toxicity revealed a signiﬁcantly
reduced lesion volume in the Nrf2 astrocyte striatum. To better
understand if astrocytic Nrf2 activation can modulate PD, GFAP-
Nrf2 mice were treated with MPTP. Dramatic protection of the
dopaminergic neurons was observed in the GFAP-Nrf2 mice fol-
lowing MPTP administration, which was sustained when the
GFAP-Nrf2 mice were on an Nrf2-/- background [108]. GFAP-Nrf2
mice were then crossed with the Thy1-hSYNA53T to evaluate if Nrf2
overexpression in astrocytes could modulate hSYNA53T aggregation
and proteostasis [116]. The median survival of the hSYNA53T mice
was dramatically extended by Nrf2 overexpression in astrocytes
from 206.5
in
hSYNA53T/GFAP-Nrf2 double transgenic mice. During pathogenesis,
hSYNA53T shifted from the soluble to the insoluble/aggregated
protein fraction. Six-month-old symptomatic hSYNA53T mice had a
signiﬁcant increase in insoluble/aggregated hSynA53T that was
completely reversed by overexpression of Nrf2 in astrocytes. The
insoluble hSYNA53T was also highly phosphorylated (Ser129)
(p-hSYNA53T) and immunohistochemically co-localized with
hSYNA53T aggregates and p62. Again, these observations were
completely reversed by GFAP-Nrf2. Autophagic dysfunction was
also observed in the in hSYNA53T mice. Reduced macroautophagy,
as well as impaired chaperone-mediated autophagy, was noted in
the hSYNA53T mice. Astrocytic Nrf2 activation prevented neuronal

autophagic dysfunction and correlated with increased lifespan and
reduced hSYNA53T aggregation in the hSYNA53T/GFAP-Nrf2 mice.
These data suggest that Nrf2 activation in astrocytes stabilizes
proteostasis and reduces oxidative stress in neurons over-
expressing hSYNA53T. The question of how this works mechan-
istically remains to be answered.

Numerous Nrf2-activating compounds have been tested in

animal models of PD (Table 1).

In general, the data show different degrees of protection of
dopaminergic neurons in rats or mice. Three papers used Nrf2-/-
mice to show that the protective effects of the chemical being
tested were Nrf2-dependent [118, 121, 122]. Burton and colleagues
demonstrated that activation of the Nrf2 pathway by oral admin-
istration of 3 H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione (D3T) to wild-type mice
partially protected them from MPTP-induced neurotoxicity. This
protective effect was not observed in Nrf2-/- mice. Sulforaphane
treatment also showed partial protection in Nrf2þ/þ mice that
was not observed in Nrf2-/- mice [121]. In addition, of the veriﬁed
Nrf2-dependent compounds, CDDO-EA (CDDO-EA) and CDDO-
triﬂuoroethylamide (CDDO-TFEA) had signiﬁcant effects across all
endpoints measured in an MPTP study [122]. A more recent study
did not examine a compound but evaluated whether treadmill
exercise could regulate Nrf2 and modulate MPPþ pathology in rats
[113]. Exercised rats were run 60 min/day, 5 days a week, for
4 weeks. Sedentary rats were placed on the treadmill for 60 min/
day without running. MPPþ was injected into the striatum and the
rats were harvested 1 week after injection. The loss of TH-positive
neurons and TH protein levels was completely reversed by ex-
ercise. LV-shNrf2 striatal injection 1 week prior to MPPþ injection
reversed the protective effects of exercise.

4. Nrf2 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common adult-
onset motor neuron disease, caused by the progressive degen-
eration of motor neurons in the spinal cord, brain stem, and motor
cortex [[124]. Motor neurons contain ubiquitin-positive hyaline
and skein-like inclusions [125]. These inclusions contain SOD1 that
co-localizes with p62 [126]. TDP-43 (TAR DNA-binding protein)-
and FUS-positive inclusions have also been identiﬁed in ALS [127,
128]. As with AD and PD, the majority of ALS cases are sporadic

258

(sALS), with approximately 10–15% of cases associated with fa-
milial mutations (fALS). The ﬁrst mutant gene identiﬁed in fALS
was Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and the mutation
caused disease through a toxic gain of function [129]. Over 150
mutations have been identiﬁed in SOD1. Rodents overexpressing
mutated forms of hSOD1 generally develop an ALS-like phenotype
[130, 131]. Although the molecular mechanism underlying this
toxic gain of function remains unknown, toxicity to motor neurons
requires mutant SOD1 expression in non-neuronal cells as well as
in motor neurons [132]. In recent years, 24 additional genes have
been associated with sALS and fALS [133] including p62 [134],
which has a direct link to Keap1/Nrf2 and autophagy.

4.1. Nrf2 and Nrf2-dependent genes in ALS brains

Nrf2 and Keap1 have been examined in the primary motor
cortex and spinal cord of ALS patients [135]. There was a reduction
in Nrf2 mRNA and protein in ALS patient tissue relative to Nrf2
levels in control tissues, but Keap1 mRNA and protein levels did
not change. Nrf2-dependent genes were not evaluated. In addition,
Keap1 has been shown to co-localize with intracellular inclusions
in motor neurons of postmortem ALS spinal cord [67].

4.2. Nrf2 in animal models of ALS

Initial studies in the hSOD1G93A rat model of ALS demonstrated
that both the mRNA and protein levels of HO-1 and Nrf2 were
increased in spinal cord compared to those in nontransgenic lit-
termate controls [136]. Interestingly, both Nrf2 and HO-1 co-lo-
calized with reactive astrocytes in the degenerating spinal cord of
hSOD1G93A rats, leading to speculation that Nrf2 activation in as-
trocytes may be involved in determining motor neuron fate in ALS.
This concept was tested in vitro by demonstrating that Nrf2 acti-
vation in primary astrocytes increased survival of co-plated pur-
iﬁed primary motor neurons and protected the motor neurons
from a variety of insults causing motor neuron death [85, 136–
138]. In the hSOD1G93A mouse, protein levels of Nrf2, thioredoxin,
HSP-70, HO-1, NQO1, GCLC, and GCLM increased with disease
progression in lumbar spinal cord but not cortex [139, 140]. Finally,
the hSOD1G93A and hSOD1H46R/H48Q ALS models were both crossed
with the ARE-hPAP reporter mice [141]. The earliest and most
signiﬁcant activation of this genetic sensor of Nrf2 activation oc-
curred in the distal muscles of both mutant SOD mice. Subse-
quently, Nrf2 activation proceeded pathology in a retrograde
fashion along the motor pathway. In the muscles of hSOD1G93A
mice, gastrocnemius was the ﬁrst muscle to show activation at 30
days, followed by the triceps at 60 days, and intercostal muscles at
110 days. Interestingly, Nrf2 activation was isolated to type I ﬁbers,
which are known to be more resistant to degeneration than type II
ﬁber in ALS patients. Signiﬁcantly increased hPAP staining was
also observed in the motor neurons and astrocytes in the ventral
horn of the spinal cord. Thus, it appears that Nrf2 activation in the
muscle is in response to denervation and occurs prior to Nrf2 ac-
tivation in spinal cord.

Nrf2 knockout mice have been crossed with the hSOD1G93A and
hSOD1G85R models of ALS [140, 142]. The ﬁrst study found a
modest decrease in lifespan by six days in male and seven day in
female hSOD1G93A mice on an Nrf2-/- background [140]. In the
second study, Nrf2 knockout had no effect on lifespan or onset in
the hSOD1G93A and hSOD1G85R mice [142].

Viral-mediated therapy was performed using intramuscular
injection of AAV6-Nrf2. The virus can transduce axons at the
neuromuscular junction, followed by axonal retrograde transport
and expression of Nrf2 in motor neuron cell bodies [143]. The
hSOD1G93A mice were injected with either AAV6-Nrf2 or AAV6-
GFP at 30 days of age in multiple muscles (facial, tongue,

intercostal, diaphragm, and hind limbs). No effect on lifespan,
onset, motor neuron survival, or rotarod performance was ob-
served. The negative results were attributed to low viral trans-
duction efﬁciency of motor neurons. Although this may be the
case, another study using transgenic mice to drive Nrf2 over-
expression in neurons also resulted in a negative outcome [142].
Here, these investigators crossed the Thy1-cre, hSOD1G93A, and
caNrf2 mice. The caNrf2 mice carry an Nrf2 transgene that lacks
the N-terminal Neh2 domain responsible for binding to Keap1
under control of the chicken β-actin promoter. Between the pro-
moter and caNrf2 lies a transcription/translation STOP cassette
ﬂanked by loxP sites. In the presence of cre recombinase the STOP
is removed and caNrf2 is expressed. Thy1 promoter is a neuronal
selective promoter driving the expression of cre recombinase,
which allowed the overexpression of caNrf2 in neurons. Although
neuronal overexpression of caNrf2 in hSOD1G93A led to a sig-
niﬁcant seven-day delay in onset, there was no signiﬁcant effect
on survival.

Based on the ARE-hPAP expression proﬁle in hSOD1G93A mice
discussed earlier, overexpression of Nrf2 in the degenerating type
II ﬁber was hypothesized. Transgenic mice were generated using
the MLC1 (myosin light chain 1) promoter driving expression of
Nrf2 selectively in type II ﬁber of skeletal muscle [142]. Similarly to
the neuronal overexpression of Nrf2, there was a signiﬁcant eight-
day delay in onset, but no signiﬁcant effect on survival.

The most compelling data come from experiments using
transgenic GFAP-Nrf2 mice that overexpress Nrf2 only in astro-
cytes [85]. Crossing these mice with the hSOD1G93A mice sig-
niﬁcantly delayed onset by 17 days and extended lifespan by 20.5
days. Furthermore, a delay in astrogliosis, but more importantly a
signiﬁcant attenuation of microglial activation, was observed. Fi-
nally, there was reduced neuronal loss and muscle denervation in
the GFAP-Nrf2/hSOD1G93A mice.

The published data on Nrf2-activating compounds is more
limited in ALS than in PD. This may be a reﬂection of either a lack
of experimental studies using Nrf2-activating compounds or the
failure of these compounds with no subsequent publications. For
example, sulforaphane has been used and failed without publica-
tion (personal communication). Some of the same compounds
used in PD models, CDDO-EA and CDDO-TFEA, have been used in
ALS models [144]. These compounds were fed in the diet and
feeding was initiated at 30 and at 75 days of age (onset) to
hSOD1G93A mice. The former treatment protocol resulted in an
extension of lifespan by 20.6 days for CDDO-EA and 17.6 days for
CDDO-TFEA. The latter treatment protocol resulted in an extension
of lifespan by 17.5 days for CDDO-EA and 16 days for CDDO-TFEA.
Feng and colleagues tested DL-3-n-butylphthalide in hSOD1G93A
mice [145]. The compound was administered by gavage once a day
starting at onset, and there was a signiﬁcant extension of lifespan
at the highest dose of approximately 18 days. This was accom-
panied by increased neuronal survival and suppression of neu-
roinﬂammation (astrocytic and microglial activation). S-[þ]-apo-
morphine was identiﬁed as an Nrf2 activator in a compound
screen and used to treat hSOD1G93A mice [146]. Drug treatment
was started at 21 days and continued until end stage. Although,
there was some delay in onset and behavioral outcome measures,
there was no effect on lifespan. CPN-9 was identiﬁed through an in
silico drug screen to identify compounds that suppress oxidative
stress-induced cell death and was subsequently shown to be an
Nrf2-activating compound [147]. hSOD1H46R mice were treated
with CPN-9 by gavage at the day of onset, demonstrating a small,
but signiﬁcant, sixday extension of lifespan at the highest dose of
CPN-9. Finally, the same group produced a novel acylaminoimi-
dazole derivative, WN1316, based on the structure of CPN-9 that
retained Nrf2 activity [148]. The hope was to develop a compound
with better pharmacokinetics for the treatment of ALS. Again,

treatment was initiated at onset in both the hSOD1H46R and
hSOD1G93A mice and a signiﬁcant extension of survival of
hSOD1H46R by nine days and hSOD1G93A by eight days was seem at
the highest dose of WN1316. There was also a delay in neuronal
loss, as well as reduced astrocytic and microglial activation.

5. Nrf2 in Huntington’s disease

HD is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease that
is associated with expansion of a CAG repeat in the gene encoding
the Htt protein [149]. This results in a stretch of N-terminal glu-
tamine residues, and the severity and onset of disease correlates
with the length of this polyglutamine repeat. Furthermore, a
conformational change in the Htt increases self–aggregation as-
sociated with intracellular inclusion formation [150]. HD is pa-
thologically characterized by degeneration in neostriatal (caudate
and putamen) and cerebral cortex that is believed to be the un-
derlying contributor to motor impairment, cognitive decline, and
psychiatric symptoms, which worsen as the disease progresses.
Oxidative stress due to mitochondrial dysfunction has been im-
plicated in human patients [151]. Defects in mitochondrial com-
plex II, III, and IV were observed in striatum of postmortem HD
brain [152, 153].

5.1. Nrf2 and Nrf2-dependent genes in HD brains

Surprisingly little work has been done on HD tissues and Nrf2.
There has been only one study examining Nrf2 or Nrf2-dependent
genes in postmortem HD brains [154],
in which HO-1 im-
munohistochemical staining was increased in HD brain.

5.2. Nrf2 in animal models of HD

Malonate and 3-nitropropionic acid (3NP), mitochondrial
complex II inhibitors, produce striatal medium spiny neuron de-
generation, a characteristic feature observed in HD [155, 156].
Malonate-treated ARE-hPAP reporter mice show signiﬁcant in-
creases in hPAP activity in astrocytes that form the border of the
penumbra [157, 158]. Malonate also increased Nrf2 and HO-1
mRNA levels in mouse striatum seven days after injection into
striatum [158]. In the 3NP model, HO-1 and NQO1 protein levels
were increased in rat striatum [159]. However, another study using
3NP did not demonstrate changes in Nrf2 protein or mRNA levels
of NQO1, HO-1, GCLM, or glutathione-S-transferase P1 [160]. The
- (a cystine transport sys-
Nrf2-depdendent subunit of system xc
tem), xCT, is reduced in R6/2 striatum, suggesting the possible
disruption of Nrf2 activity in the mouse model [161]. Expanding
on the role of Nrf2 in the malonate and 3NP HD models, Nrf2-/-
mice exposed to these agents had more signiﬁcant lesion volumes
at doses that had little or no effect in wild type mice [157, 162,
163].

In addition, Calkins and colleagues demonstrated that Ad-
Nrf2-, in contrast to Ad-GFP-transduced primary astrocyte and
mouse neural progenitor cells transplanted into the mouse stria-
tum had signiﬁcant protection from malonate toxicity [157, 158].
Four to ﬁve weeks after transplantation of both cell types, the mice
were injected with malonate and Ad-Nrf2 transplanted striatum
had an 80–90% reduction in lesion volume. Direct injection of Ad-
Nrf2 into the striatum also conferred signiﬁcant but less protection
against 3NP toxicity [162]. Malonate was also injected into the
striatum of GFAP-Nrf2 mice, and similarly, the GFAP-Nrf2 mice
were more resistant to malonate [158]. Interestingly, there was no
difference in baseline levels of Nrf2-dependent genes in GFAP-Nrf2
striatum. In addition, astrocytic and microglial activation were not
attenuated. However, there was dramatic acceleration and robust

Nrf2 activation that occurred within 24 h of malonate dosing in
the GFAP-Nrf2 mice. In contrast, the wild type mice had virtually
no increased Nrf2, suggesting that activation of the Nrf2 pathway
after a toxic insult could be beneﬁcial.

Similar to PD and ALS models, CDDO-MA has been tested in the
3NP model, whereas CDDO-EA and CDDO-TFEA have been tested
using the N171-82Q mouse model of HD [164, 165]. In all cases,
signiﬁcant protection was observed. The N171-28Q mice were
started on diets containing the CDDO compounds at 30 days of
age. Lifespan was increased 34 and 29 days for CDDO-EA and
CDDO-TFEA, respectively. However, Nrf2-/- mice were not used in
these studies. Another group fed tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), a
well-known Nrf2-activating compound, to Nrf2þ/- and Nrf2-/-
mice followed by 3NP administration [162]. tBHQ was started
1 week prior to initiating the 3NP, and the data showed protection
with tBHQ in Nrf2þ/- but not Nrf2-/- mice. A similar experiment
gave cystamine once daily for seven days to Nrf2þ/þ and Nrf2-/-
mice prior to starting 3NP dosing [163]. The Nrf2þ/þ mice given
cystamine did not have any striatal lesions, and in the Nrf2-/-,
cystamine actually signiﬁcantly increased lesion volume. The R6/2
and YAC128 models of HD were treated with dimethylfumarate
(DMF), another known Nrf2-activating compound [166]. DMF
dosing twice daily via gavage began at 4 weeks of age in the R6/2
mice. Survival was extended from 94 to 100.5 days and was as-
sociated with preserved muscle function and body weight, as well
as increased number of intact neurons. Formation of intracellular
ubiquitin-positive Htt aggregates, however, was not affected by
DMF treatment. DMF treatment of YAC128 mice resulted in re-
duced clasping score and neuronal loss in the striatum and cortex
at 1 year of age. Two additional compounds, naringin, a ﬂavonone
from grapefruit, and protopanaxtriol, a compound isolated from
ginseng, protect against 3NP-induced neurodegeneration [159,
160]. Much more work is required in the HD and genetic HD
models to better understand how Nrf2 can modulate HD pathol-

effects of neuronal versus astrocytic Nrf2 overexpression in R6/2
transgenic and zQ175 knockin mice.

6. Nrf2 in multiple sclerosis

It is estimated that as many as 400,000 people in the United
States and more than 2.3 million people worldwide are affected by
multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is a chronic neuroinﬂammatory dis-
ease onset by activation of peripheral CD4þ T cells that traverse
the blood–brain barrier and mount a damaging autoimmune at-
tack on myelin and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system
(CNS) [167]. Neurological deﬁcits manifest in heterogenic condi-
tions that include but are not limited to vision loss, dyscoordina-
tion, weakness, sensory loss, and cognitive changes, as well as
bladder and bowel dysfunction. Pathology of MS is attributed to
the pathogenic attack on myelin sheathing and oligodendrocytes
by autoreactive CD4þ Th1 and Th17 cells, as well as inﬁltrating
macrophages and resident microglia, resulting in axonal retraction
and astrogliosis. The reactive microglia and astrocytes, in turn,
secrete inﬂammatory mediators that not only include cytokines
and chemokines, but also produce reactive oxygen and nitrogen
species that contribute to oxidative stress, exacerbating the al-
ready deleterious effects of the neuroinﬂammatory-associated
tissue damage contributing to the disease progression [168, 169].
Today, there are currently eight therapies approved by the FDA for
the treatment of relapsing remitting MS, the most common (∼87%
of MS patients) of the four clinical forms of this disease, which
focus primarily on preventing the penetration of immune cells
across the blood–brain barrier. However, the extreme complexity
and heterogeneity of the disease, therapy resistance developed

260

over time, and the more current dogma that oxidative stress
contributes to the disease, warrants further investigation to im-
prove and/or contribute to existing treatments [170].

6.1. Nrf2 and Nrf2-dependent genes in MS brain lesions

Severe oxidative damage has been observed in lesions from MS
brain tissue and attributed to the inﬂammatory-mediated gen-
eration of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Expression of
antioxidant proteins and enzymes, as well as Nrf2 protein, coin-
cided with cellular stress markers in active lesions when com-
pared with normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) and white
matter tissue from non-neurological control brains [171–173].
Thus, activation of an Nrf2-mediated antioxidant response may
reﬂect protective cellular defense mechanisms against the oxida-
tive stress-mediated damage associated with persistent
in-
ﬂammation. Initial studies identiﬁed NQO1, a well-known Nrf2-
regulated enzyme, as highly up-regulated in active and highly
active MS lesions, particularly in hypertrophic astrocytes and
myelin-laden macrophages. Oligodendrocytes sporadically dis-
played NQO1 immunnoreactivity, while neuronal NQO1 staining
was rarely observed [171]. Subsequent studies identiﬁed active MS
lesions as being immunoreactive for the oxidative stress markers
4-HNE, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, and nitrotyrosine,with these
same active lesions coexpressing the antioxidant enzymes HO-1,
SOD1, SOD2, and catalase. Similarly to the expression of NQO1, this
staining was morphologically and histochemically identiﬁed as
being present in hypertrophic astrocytes and myelin-laden mac-
rophages with modest or no staining in NAWM. Consistent with
the expression of antioxidants, up-regulation of Nrf2 in MS lesions
was localized to both the nucleus and cytoplasm of inﬁltrating
macrophages and reactive astrocytes, with weak expression in
oligodendrocytes bordering active lesions [173].

6.2. Nrf2 and animal models of MS

Studies using mouse models of multiple sclerosis indicate the
importance of Nrf2 in the progress and/or prevention of this de-
myelinating neuroinﬂammatory disease. For
instance, Nrf2
knockout mice immunized with myelin oligodendrocytic protein
(MOG 35–55) to induce an acute autoimmune experimental au-
toimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a humanized model of MS in
mice, demonstrated a more severe course of disease, a more rapid
onset, and a greater percentage of Nrf2 knockout mice with EAE. In
spines from diseased mice, there were more severe demyelination
and increased immune cell inﬁltration and glia cell activation, as
well as increased mRNA expression of inﬂammatory enzymes
(iNOS, phox-47, gp91-phox, and phox-67), cytokines (IFN-gamma,
IL1-b, and IL-12) and chemokines (BLC and MIG), in Nrf2-deﬁcient
mice than in WT mice, further suggesting that Nrf2 can modulate
autoimmune neuroinﬂammatory responses [174].

More recently, compound- or natural product-mediated acti-
vation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway has been found to ameliorate
oxidative stress and neuroinﬂammation in EAE and MS [175–178],
supporting the notion that induction of Nrf2 in both mouse and
human can prevent or alleviate the pathogenesis associated with
MS and EAE. Remarkable examples are the fumaric acid esters
(FAE), methyl hydrogen fumarate (MHF), and DMF. These were
previously used for effective treatment of the autoimmune skin
disorder psoriasis via immunomodulation and immunosuppres-
sion. Treatment with DMF also had a signiﬁcant therapeutic effect
on clinical scores of disease and reduced macrophage inﬂamma-
tion in spinal cords of EAE mice versus control treatments [179].
Interestingly, in early studies using murine primary astrocytes,
DMF, a strong glutathione-depleting agent, had been shown to
activate the Nrf2-ARE pathway [180]. Both DMF and MMF

(monomethyl fumarate; a primary metabolite of DMF) have been
shown to react with the Keap1 cysteine 151 residue (cys151) in
studies using Keap1-C151S mutant macrophages and mass spec-
trometric analysis of astrocytes, respectively [175, 181]. It was
further demonstrated that the FAE indeed had neuroprotective
effects in EAE via activation of the Nrf2 pathway. Preventative or
therapeutic (after disease was initiated) application of DMF atte-
nuated disease severity and improved preservation of myelin,
axons, and neurons, which did not occur in Nrf2-/- mice. Im-
munoreactivity for protein nitrosylated tyrosines, indicative of
oxidative stress, was reduced in spinal cord sections from mice
with EAE by treatment with DMF. Furthermore, induction of Nrf2
in neurons of the motor cortex and brainstem, astrocytes of spinal
cord gray matter, and oligodendrocytes from spinal cord white
matter was observed [175]. Treatments of animals or primary
cultures of CNS cells with DMF or MMF resulted in increased levels
of Nrf2 nuclear localization, as well as increased levels of canonical
antioxidant target genes that were not observed in Nrf2 knockout
mice [182]. DMF (BG-12) has proved effective in Phase III clinical
trials for the treatment of relapsing MS and was approved for use
by the FDA in March of 2013. Importantly, biopsies from a patient
with MS, as well as three psoriasis patients with progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (single cases in connection with
FAE treatments), identiﬁed astrocytes as staining positive for both
nuclear and cytoplasmic Nrf2, whereas oligodendrocytes had
mostly cytoplasmic staining and only on single occasions nuclear
Nrf2 staining [183]. Thus, although FAE indeed modulates immune
function in MS, activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway may also
be an important mechanism of action for the prevention of oxi-
dative-stress-induced neuronal toxicity.

In addition to the FAE, several more recent studies using nat-
ural compounds such as sulforaphane, an organosulfur compound
found in cruciferous vegetables, and matrine, a quinolizidine al-
kaloid derived from the herb Sophora ﬂavescens, as well as CDDO-
TFEA, a derivative of the natural triterpene oleanolic acid, have all
been identiﬁed as attenuating EAE through Nrf2-modulatory, as
well as immunomodulatory mechanisms [176–178]. More speci-
ﬁcally, sulforaphane was shown to ameliorate EAE by preserving
the blood–brain barrier, reducing the levels of the autoimmune T
cell, Th17, in addition to antagonizing oxidative stress via activa-
tion of Nrf2, as evidenced by increased expression of NQO1 and
HO-1 in brain tissues of treated mice [177]. Matrine treatments
also were effective in EAE, by which tissue from spinal cord im-
munohistochemically identiﬁed increased protein levels of Nrf2
and HO-1 in treated mice [178]. Last, CDDO-TFEA completely
suppressed EAE disease in mice, presumably through suppression
of inﬂammatory cytokines, speciﬁcally IL-17, and induction of
Nrf2-dependent antioxidant gene expression in both CNS and
peripheral lymphocytes. In addition, CDDO-TFEA enhanced myelin
repair in a lysophosphatidylcholine-induced model of demyelina-
tion [176]. Alleviation of neuroinﬂammatory-induced oxidative
stress through activation of Nrf2 and induction of antioxidant is
thus an important therapeutic target for prevention of oxidative
stress associated with MS, other autoimmune disorders, as well as
neuroinﬂammation associated with other neurodegenerative
diseases.

7. Nrf2 and neuroinﬂammation

A pathological hallmark feature of neurodegenerative disease is
neuroinﬂammation, mediated primarily by activated resident in-
nate immune cells, the microglia. When activated, microglia secrete
cytotoxic reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, contributing to
the deleterious affects on neurons, especially in cases of microglial
overactivation and dysregulation. Furthermore, components of

D.A. Johnson, J.A. Johnson / Free Radical Biology and Medicine 88 (2015) 253–267

261

dead or damaged neurons also activate microglia (reactive micro-
gliosis) via pattern recognition receptors (e.g., toll-like receptors),
resulting in a perpetuating cycle of neuronal cell death [184, 185]. In
an adult human brain, cell densities of microglia are brain-region-
dependent and range from 0.5 to 16.6%. Under normal conditions,
they reside predominantly in a resting ramiﬁed-like morphology in
the gray matter, with the highest concentrations found in hippo-
campus, olfactory telencephalon, basal ganglia, and substantia nigra
[185, 186]. Thus, it comes as no surprise that these brain regions
may be more susceptible to reactive microgliosis, as observed in
several neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD, PD, HD, and ALS
[187].

The most abundant source of reactive species produced by
microglia is initiation of the NADPH oxidase (NOX) system gen-
erating superoxide anions (O2 ). Upon activation by various sti-
muli, including pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs),
inﬂammatory cytokines, and/or neurotoxins,
the membrane-
bound NOX enzyme complex innately promotes microbial killing,
as well as changes in morphology, cellular migration, and regula-
tion of proinﬂammatory gene expression. However, persistent
activation of NOX results in peroxidation of lipids and other
macromolecules and activation of apoptosis,
thus promoting
neuronal cell death and degeneration. Similarly, inducible nitric
oxide synthase (iNOS) enzyme is induced and its activation results
in generation of nitric oxide (NO), which like O2  is neurotoxic
at continuously high levels. High concentrations of NO unbalance
redox homeostasis, and NO can also react with O2 , resulting in
a more toxic reactive species, peroxynitrite (ONNO ) [188].
Under resting conditions, microglia continuously survey the
surrounding environment in search of pathogens, sick cells, or
cellular debris, as well as participating in synaptic remodeling and/
or maintenance. However, upon activation by hazardous compo-
nents, microglia become active and in turn secrete proin-
ﬂammatory mediators such as TNF, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-12,
and IL-23. This phase of microglia activation is commonly known
as the classical proinﬂammatory phase and termed M1. Following
the M1 phase is a longer-lasting anti-inﬂammatory or alternative
phase, M2. Microglia in this phase are activated by anti-in-
ﬂammatory cytokines, which include IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13. Sub-
sequently, these same cytokines are produced, in addition to in-
creased expression of genes involved in wound healing, such as
arginase-1 (ARG1), mannose receptors (MMC),
found in in-
ﬂammatory zone 1 (FIZZ1), and chitinase-3-like-1 (Ym1 in ro-
dents). Under normal conditions however, the microglia anti-
oxidant machinery maintains cellular homeostasis and thus mi-
croglia are maintained in steady state surveillance mode [185].

The master regulator of the inﬂammatory responses to brain
infections and environmental and cellular damage is the tran-
scription factor NF-kappaB (NF-kß), and it is the redox state of
microglia that controls regulatory kinases upstream of NF-kß, as
well as NF-kß nuclear levels (recently reviewed in [185]). Microglia
function normally when basal levels of OS are managed by anti-
oxidant machinery; however, persistent OS or NS continuously
activates the NF-kß signaling pathway, amplifying the proin-
ﬂammatory function of microglia and thus contributing to mi-
croglial overactivation and neurotoxic consequences. Thus, the
transcription factor Nrf2, associated with activation of antioxidant
genes and redox homeostasis, is the master regulator of microglia
fate, protecting microglia from oxidative stress and overactivation
of the M1 phenotype. More speciﬁcally, activation of Nrf2 drives
expression levels of genes involved in: 1) OS clearance - SOD3,
GPx, and Prx; 2) reducing factor production - GCLM/C; 3) NADPH
generation - glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and/or phos-
phogluconate dehydrogenase; 4) regeneration of reduced cofac-
tors and proteins - GR, Trx-TrxR, Prx/sulﬁredoxin, or redox trans-
ferritin; and
porters, xCT; 5) metal chelation - MT1/2 or

6) antioxidant activity - HO-1, NQO1, and Trx, and inhibition of the
expression of the Trx inhibitor, TXNIP [185].

Several studies have described Nrf2 as a therapeutic target
for the alleviation of brain inﬂammation associated with neuro-
degeneration and subsequent neuronal protection. In one study,
Nrf2-/- mice injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a common
inﬂammogen, were hypersensitive to LPS-induced neuroin-
ﬂammation in hippocampal tissue. Protein and mRNA for the
cellular microglia marker F4/80 were increased in hippocampi of
Nrf2-/- mice compared with WT mice, as were the inﬂammatory
markers iNOS, IL-6, and TNF-α. Additionally, mice treated with SFN
displayed a two- to three-fold increase in HO-1, a reduced abun-
dance of microglia, and an attenuated production of these same
inﬂammatory markers in response to LPS [189]. SFN-treated rats
subjected to spinal cord injury had signiﬁcantly increased levels of
Nrf2 and GCL and decreased levels of the inﬂammatory cytokines,
IL-1ß and TNF-α, resulting in reduced contusion volume and im-
proved coordination [190].

In a mouse model of PD, inoculation of MPTP in Nrf2-/- mice
demonstrated hypersensitivity to OS, with basal ganglia of these
mice exhibiting more severe dopaminergic dysfunction when
compared with WT littermate controls. Although Cd11b-positive/
CD45 highly stained cells, indicative of peripheral macrophage
inﬁltration, were not signiﬁcantly different between WT and
Nrf2-/- mice, the latter mice exhibited more astro- and micro-
gliosis, as determined by increased expression levels of message
and protein for GFAP and F4/80 [120]. This validated earlier studies
showing increased neuroinﬂammation associated with astrocytic
(GFAP) and microglia (Iba-1) activation in Nrf2-/- mice exposed to
MPTP [108]. Furthermore, inﬂammatory markers for classically
activated microglia (M1), COX2, iNOS, IL-6, and TNF-α were also
increased, while markers for alternatively activated microglia
(M2), FIZZ-1, YM-1, arginase-1, and IL-4, were decreased. These
results demonstrate a critical role of Nrf2 in the modulation of
neuroinﬂammation secondary to a neurotoxic insult [120].

In hippocampus of mice that were stereotactically injected
with an adeno-associated viral vector expressing TAUP301L (indu-
cing a mouse model of tauopathy), Nrf2-/- mice showed increased
microgliosis and astrogliosis. This was veriﬁed by mRNA levels for
TNF and IL-6 in hippocampus, as well as immunohistochemical
staining for Iba-1 and GFAP. In contrast to WT mice, hippocampal
mRNA levels for HO-1 and GCLC did not increase in the Nrf2-/- nor
did cellular staining for HO-1. This suggests that the Nrf2 signaling
pathway was activated by TAUP301L-induced pathology in an at-
tempt to modulate the inﬂammatory response. Based on these
observations, as well as studies demonstrating that neuronal ex-
pression of the chemokine fractalkine (CX3CL1) modulates TAU-
mediated neuroinﬂammation, these same authors demonstrated
that CX3CL1 secreted by injured neurons acted on CX3CR1 re-
ceptors (exclusive to microglia), activating the Nrf2-ARE signaling
pathway and attenuating TAUP301L -induced microgliosis. The lat-
ter studies were supported by observations of increased hippo-
campal microgliosis in CX3CR1-deﬁcient mice in response to
TAUP301L, when compared with WT controls, in addition to the
complete loss of the Nrf2-dependent HO-1 immunohistochemical
staining in this same cohort. Thus, the release of the chemokine
CX3CL1 by injured neurons in turn communicates to microglia via
the CX3CR1 receptor, subsequently activating the Nrf2-ARE path-
way, to dampen the neuroinﬂammatory response to injury [191].
In another study using mouse primary neuronal microglia-
conditioned media and co-culture experiments, the release of the
milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 (MFG-E8) from microglia in response
to signals from degenerating neurons exposed to neurotoxic oli-
gomeric Aß enhanced the phagocytic activity of microglia. Ad-
ditionally, microglia treated with MFG-E8 activated the Nrf2 sig-
naling pathway and HO-1. However, in neuronal–microglia co-

262

D.A. Johnson, J.A. Johnson / Free Radical Biology and Medicine 88 (2015) 253–267

cultures, the neuroprotection afforded by MFG-E8 was reversed
with the HO-1 inhibitor, Tin (IV)-mesoporphyrin IX dichloride
(SnMP) treatment, suggesting the importance of HO-1 increase in
microglia and subsequent protection of neurons from toxicity
[192]. These studies suggest that cellular communication between
neurons and microglia and activation of the Nrf2 signaling path-
way may be a novel therapeutic approach in the protection of
neurons, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases.

8. NFE2L2 and Keap1 associated haplotypes and neurodegen-
erative diseases

Based on substantial evidence (as discussed in this review) that
neurodegenerative effects of OS/NS in diseases such as PD, AD, and
ALS can be modulated and/or prevented by up-regulation of Nrf2,
genomic studies have been undertaken to ascertain if common
genetic variations exist in the genes encoding Nrf2 and its re-
pressor protein Keap1, NFE2L2 and Keap1, thus contributing to the
onset or risk of these diseases. Interestingly, based on compilation
of publicly available SNPs and other genetic variations, it is esti-
mated that the mutagenic frequency of human NFE2L2 is 1 per
72 bp, suggesting that several polymorphisms of this gene may
exist [193]. In initial case-controlled studies of patients with PD,
von Otter et al. identiﬁed a protective NFE2L2 haplotype, GAG-
CAAAA, which included a fully functional variant of the Nrf2
promoter associated with high transcriptional activity in Swedish
and Polish material [194]. In the Swedish case study, the GAAAA
haplotype allele was associated with an estimated increased age at
onset (AAO) of PD of approximately ﬁve years per haplotype allele
(p¼0.001); while in the Polish study, the full protective haplotype,
GAGCAAAA, showed a decrease in risk of PD with odds ratios of
0.4 and 0.2 for heterozygous and homozygous carriers, respec-
tively (p¼2  10 6). Additionally, the Swedish material identiﬁed
the haplotypes GAGGG and GAAAG in association with increased
risk of PD with odds of 2.4 and 3.7 per allele, respectively. Inter-
estingly, the promoter haplotype AGA showed a tendency toward
increased risk of PD and full risk with the full promoter haplotype
GAGAAGGG (odds ratio of 2.8 per haplotype allele). However, the
full haplotype allele, GAGCAAAA, was estimated to delay PD AAO
per haplotype allele. No individual SNPs alone, however, sig-
niﬁcantly affected risk of PD in either Swedish or Polish material.
In addition, genetic variations of Keap1 were also analyzed; how-
ever, no associations to AAO or risk of PD were detected [194].

A more recent meta-analysis of genetic associations of Nrf2-
encoding NFE2L2 variants in PD using the above data in addition to
four new independent European patient-control materials (from
Malta, Germany, Italy, and a second Swedish study) also demon-
strated an association of haplotype GAGCAAAA (including the fully
functional promoter haplotype AGC) with decreased risk (odds
ratio (OR) of 0.8 per allele, p¼0.012) and delayed onset of (þ1.1
years per allele, p¼0.048) of PD [195]. These results supported the
initial haplotype study that associated variations in the NFE2L2
gene with pathogenesis of PD. The latter study also described four
single nucleic acid polymorphisms (SNPs) included in the haplo-
types that were associated with AAO of PD (three SNPs that pro-
moted onset included: rs7557529 G4A, -1.0 years per allele,
p¼0.042; rs35652124 A4G, -1.1 years per allele, p¼0.045;
rs2886161 A4G, -1.2 years per allele, p¼0.021; and delayed onset
SNP: rs1806649 G4A, þ1.2 years per allele). Of note, SNP
rs35652124 is fully functional and located in the NFE2L2 promoter
[195].

In contrast with the above PD studies, genetic analysis of
the NFE2L2 promoter did not show variation in a Taiwanese
patient controlled PD study. Three SNPs located in the NFE2L2
promoter, rs35652124, rs6706649, and rs6721961, were analyzed

independently or with haplotype variants that were associated
with PD susceptibility, yet did not correlate with PD susceptibility.
The authors concluded that the disparity between the Taiwanese
and European studies might be attributed to genomic differences
in ethnicity and environmental factors in different geographical
regions [196].

Similar studies using AD Swedish case-controlled material did not
support NFE2L2 or Keap1 single SNPs or haplotypes as risk suscept-
ibility genes for AD [197]. However, haplotype analysis of age at AD
onset showed a signiﬁcant association of haplotype GAAAA with
2 years earlier age at AD onset (p¼0.013), suggesting that common
variants of the NFE2L2 gene may affect AD progression thus altering
clinically recognized disease onset. Gene variants of NFE2L2 or Keap1
were not associated with results of mini-mental state examination
(MMSE) or CSF biomarker levels of total tau protein and Aß 1–42
in these same AD case-control studies [197].

Swedish case-control studies of NFE2L2 and Keap1 in ALS dis-
ease identiﬁed one NFE2L2 haplotype (GGGAC) associated with
decreased risk of sporadic ALS (OR¼0.62 per allele, p¼0.015) and
one haplotype in Keap1 (CGC) correlated with delayed sporadic
ALS onset (þ3.4 years per allele, p¼0.015). In addition, further
stratiﬁcation of ALS into subgroups identiﬁed one subgroup having
an NFE2L2-associated haplotype of GAGCAGA, which included
three functional promoter SNPs associated with high levels of Nrf2
protein expression, with 4.0 years delayed onset of ALS per allele
(p¼0.008) [198]. In one other case-controlled study in Italian ALS
patients, three NFE2L2 promoter polymorphisms (SNP -653 A/G,
-651 G/A, and -617 C/A), no signiﬁcant differences were observed
between ALA cases and controls. The -653 A/G promoter poly-
morphism was slightly higher in patients than in controls, but it
did not attain signiﬁcance. Furthermore, oxidative stress bio-
markers assessed in this same study did not associate with and
were independent from the NFE2L2 promoter polymorphisms
surveyed [193]. Similar studies have not yet been conducted on HD
or MS patients.

9. Conclusions

Based on the information provided herein, the Nrf2-ARE
pathway is a high-value therapeutic target for neurodegenerative
diseases. The existing data are strongest for PD, ALS, and MS, but
ongoing experiments in AD and HD should provide more insight
into how important Nrf2 is in these diseases as well. Numerous
cell-based and in silico high-throughput screens have identiﬁed
novel Nrf2-activating compounds [199–205]. The most promising
approach may be to ﬁnd compounds that noncovalently disrupt
the DLG or ETGE motif interactions with Keap1 [206, 207]. Cur-
rently, DMF (BG-12) from Biogen Idec has been FDA-approved for
treating MS. As discussed above, DMF has also been tested in
preclinical models of HD; however, only the CDDO compounds
have been tested in preclinical models of the all diseases discussed
in this review. Reata Pharmaceuticals moved the ﬁrst CDDO
compound (Bardoxolone methyl; CDDO methyl ester) into a Phase
III clinical trial for the treatment of chronic kidney disease. Un-
fortunately, the trial was stopped in 2012 due to a higher rate of
cardiovascular events observed in the bardoxolone methyl group
compared to placebo [208]. A new CDDO derivative (RTA 408) is
already developed and being tested in clinical trials for a variety of
non-neurodegenerative diseases,
[209–212]. More recently, a
clinical trial using RTA 408 was initiated for Friedreich’s ataxia, a
neurodegenerative condition responsible for cerebellar ataxia due
to impaired production of the protein frataxin leading to profound
deﬁciencies in mitochondrial respiration (ClinicalTrials.gov Iden-
tiﬁer NCT02255435). Movement of these next generation CDDO
compounds into the major neurodegenerative diseases could be an

D.A. Johnson, J.A. Johnson / Free Radical Biology and Medicine 88 (2015) 253–267

263

important step forward, based on the preclinical data from earlier
generation CDDO compounds.

An interesting new twist to therapeutic approaches targeting
this pathway is that one cell type may be better than another at
protecting neurons from degeneration. The lack of protection
in vivo by overexpression of Nrf2 in neurons or muscle, but pro-
tection by overexpression in astrocytes in ALS models, as well as
PD models, highlights this concept that not only the pharmaco-
logical target, but also the cell type targeted may be relevant when
an Nrf2-dependent therapeutic approach is considered.
