Multiple sclerosis, which is the most common cause of chronic neurological disability in
young adults, is an inﬂammatory, demyelinating, and neurodegenerative disease of the CNS,
which leads to the formation of multiple foci of demyelinated lesions in the white matter.
The diagnosis is based currently on magnetic resonance image and evidence of dissemination
in time and space. However, this could be facilitated if biomarkers were available to rule
out other disorders with similar symptoms as well as to avoid cerebrospinal ﬂuid analysis,
which requires an invasive collection. Additionally, the molecular mechanisms of the disease
are not completely elucidated, especially those related to the neurodegenerative aspects of
the disease. The identiﬁcation of biomarker candidates and molecular mechanisms of multiple
sclerosis may be approached by proteomics. In the last 10 years, proteomic techniques have
been applied in different biological samples (CNS tissue, cerebrospinal ﬂuid, and blood) from
multiple sclerosis patients and in its experimental model. In this review, we summarize these
data, presenting their value to the current knowledge of the disease mechanisms, as well as
their importance in identifying biomarkers or treatment targets.

sclerosis is currently based on magnetic resonance imaging
and evidence of dissemination of the lesions in time and

Panels of biomarkers could be established to determine
diagnosis and prognosis and to stratify patients to facilitate
the prevention, unequivocal identiﬁcation, and targeted treat-
ment of multiple sclerosis, respectively. Diagnostic biomark-
ers would rule out other disorders with similar symptoms,
making the invasive collection of cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF)
unnecessary. Additionally, the molecular mechanisms of
multiple sclerosis have not been completely elucidated, es-
pecially those related to the neurodegenerative aspects of the
disease [3]. Proteomics has the ability to identify biomark-
ers and improve the understanding of human diseases and
is therefore a useful tool for meeting the needs of multiple
sclerosis research.

During the last 10 years, proteomic techniques have been
used to analyze different biological samples collected from
multiple sclerosis patients and experimental models of this
disease. In this review, we summarize these data and discuss
their value to the current understanding of the disease mech-
anisms, as well as their importance in identifying potential
biomarkers or treatment targets.

1.1 Multiple sclerosis

1.1.1 Clinical features

Charcot described multiple sclerosis in the late 19th century,
and efforts to understand this disease have not ceased since
then. Multiple sclerosis is the most common neurological
disability in young adults after traumatic events [4]. The inci-
dence of the disease varies worldwide, with a prevalence that
ranges between 2 and 150 per 100 000 depending on the spe-
ciﬁc population. The clinical symptoms of multiple sclerosis
depend on the site of the neurologic lesions. Patients often
exhibit an initial clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). In most of
patients (∼85–90%), CIS is following by a relapsing-remitting
course (RRMS) characterized by recurring attacks or exacer-
bations of existing deﬁcits (relapses), followed by partial or
full recovery (remission). Approximately 10 years later, half
of these patients convert to the secondary progressive phase
of the disease (secondary progressive multiple sclerosis), in
which there is an acceleration of the disability with accumulat-
ing and irreversible neurologic deﬁcits. A smaller percentage
of individuals (∼10–15%) develop a primary progressive form
of multiple sclerosis [1,2,5,6]. Clinically, proteomics may be a
helpful tool to stratify multiple sclerosis patients in different
phases of the disease based on distinct molecular signatures
in biological tissue from the patients.

1.1.2 Causes

Although the etiology of multiple sclerosis remains unknown,
it is highly unlikely that the disease results from a single
causative event. Current evidence suggests the involvement
of a complex genetic trait, which most likely requires en-
vironmental factors to be triggered. These risk factors most
likely act many years before disease onset during a subclinical
phase of the disorder. Genetic epidemiological studies have
shown that the genetic susceptibility is an important condi-
tion for the development of the disease. Moreover, familial
aggregation studies have shown that the risk of developing
multiple sclerosis is higher for people with family members
with multiple sclerosis, especially ﬁrst-degree relatives (10–
25 times higher). The monozygotic twin of a multiple scle-
rosis patient has a more than 100-fold higher risk than the
general population [7]. Multiple sclerosis is more common
in women than in men. However, genetic studies have not
found any relevant multiple sclerosis-associated gene on the
X chromosome [8]. The increased risk in women may be re-

lated to the female physiology or to a higher susceptibility
to environmental factors. Although the genetic background
seems to contribute decisively to the development of multi-
ple sclerosis, many studies have demonstrated a prominent
role of the environment in determining the risk of devel-
oping multiple sclerosis. The roles of many environmental
factors have been studied in recent decades; however, infec-
tions, latitude/vitamin D and social behavior (e.g. smoking)
are the only factors with strong evidence of being involved in
the augmentation of the risk of developing multiple sclero-
sis [1, 9].

The genetic association with susceptibility to multiple scle-
rosis has long been known. The ﬁrst identiﬁed genetic risk
factor, discovered during 1970s, is associated with the hu-
man leukocyte antigen (HLA) region. A strong association
was ﬁrst found with the HLA-DR2 isotype, and DNA-based
typing methods later showed that the speciﬁc allele involved
in this association is DRB1*1501. Each copy of this allele in-
creases the multiple sclerosis risk by approximately threefold
in European populations. Recently, studies have identiﬁed
ﬁve alleles in three different loci in the HLA region: the HLA-
DRB1*1501, *0301 and *0801 alleles; the HLA-A*0201 allele;
and the HLA-DPB1*0301. These alleles are associated with
changes between 26 and 200% in MS risk. Protection from
the disease may also be associated with some HLA class II
alleles [10–12]. Many years after the discovery of the DR2 al-
lele, genome-wide association studies and other studies have
shown that several non-HLA genes have modest effects on the
risk of multiple sclerosis. These genes include interleukin-7
receptor ␣ (IL-7RA), interleukin 2 receptor ␣, C-type lectin-
domain family 16 member A, CD58, tumor-necrosis-factor
receptor superfamily member 1A, interferon regulatory fac-
tor 8, and CD6. In 2011, the largest genome-wide study com-
pleted to date, performed by the International Multiple Scle-
rosis Genetics Consortium, evaluated 9772 multiple sclerosis
cases and 17 376 shared controls. This study identiﬁed more
the 1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms. This study
conﬁrmed the associations with 23 previously reported loci
and identiﬁed 29 new candidates [13–16]. Most of these genes
were already known to have direct immune functions or to
be involved in immunological pathways. Interestingly, many
of the identiﬁed genes have also been reported to be asso-
ciated with at least one other autoimmune disease. These
results reinforce the hypothesis that some, if not all, autoim-
mune diseases share similar mechanisms. Sometimes it is
possible to identify these phenomena in the clinic, and it is
not uncommon for a multiple sclerosis patient to have an-
other autoimmune disorder [17,18]. Although the knowledge
about genetic risk factors has increased enormously in the
past decade, there are still gaps to be ﬁlled. Therefore, fur-
ther studies are required to answer questions regarding how
genetic factors inﬂuence the age of onset, evolution, and
severity of multiple sclerosis. Given the known inﬂuence of
genetics on the development of multiple sclerosis, studies
to identify predictive biomarkers should employ proteomic
technologies and samples from patients’ family members.

1.1.3 Molecular features

Currently, it is well accepted that multiple sclerosis is a
chronic inﬂammatory disease of the CNS that is associated
with the destruction of the myelin sheaths, leading to de-
myelination. Along with myelin sheath degradation, there
is substantial axonal damage that subsequently jeopardizes
nerve conductivity [19].

Although demyelination is the primary characteristic of
the multiple sclerosis lesions in the CNS, recent studies
have provided evidence that the tissue damage may affect
the gray matter (GM) as well. Numerous studies have shown
that changes in the GM are closely associated with physical
disability and cognitive impairment [20–24]. Cortical lesions
occur early during CIS and RRMS, as well as in primary
progressive multiple sclerosis, and increase in number and
size with progression of the disease [25,26]. According to the
original pathological study, GM lesions comprise 26% of all
lesions identiﬁed in the CNS [27].

Although certain molecular aspects of multiple sclerosis,
such as the demyelination, are well described, the general
molecular basis of multiple sclerosis is still unclear. The un-
derstanding of these molecular mechanisms may improve
with the application of proteomic techniques, given the abil-
ity of these techniques to provide systems biology knowledge.

1.2 Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis

Described by Rivers, Sprunt, and Berry in 1933 [28], the ex-
perimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model is
the best-characterized and most-studied experimental model
for neurological disease. The EAE model shares many clin-
ical and histopathological features with multiple sclerosis,
and therefore, it has been used as a preclinical model for the
human disease [29]. EAE is an inﬂammatory demyelinating
disease of the CNS. This experimental model can be induced
in a large number of genetically susceptible mammal species
by immunization with myelin compounds or by the adoptive
transfer of pre-activated auto-aggressive T cells [30–32]. The
disease was ﬁrst described as a Th1-mediated pathology [33].
Th1 cells express and release proinﬂammatory cytokines such
as IFN-␥ and TNF-␣ in response to IL-12 stimulation [34]. Th1
cells are found in the CNS lesions of ill animals, and more
importantly, the adoptive transfer of Th1 cells from the pe-
ripheral organs of an EAE donor can induce the disease in a
na¨ıve host [35,36]. However, recent studies have noted the role
of Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of EAE and other autoim-
mune diseases [37–39]. Th17 lymphocytes express and release
IL-17 and IL-22 in response to IL-23, IL-6, and TGF-␤ stimula-
tion [34]. The effector phase of the disease is characterized by
the migration of auto-aggressive CD4+ T cells into the CNS
and by the release of proinﬂammatory cytokines [36,40]. The
myelin destruction seems to be associated directly with the ac-
tions of TNF-␣, LT-␤, proteolytic enzymes, free radicals, and
nitric oxide released inside the CNS parenchyma [41–44]. In

addition to the direct effect of inﬂammatory mediators on the
myelin sheath, the release of proinﬂammatory cytokines in-
side the CNS increases the vascular permeability [45], which
is considered an indirect effect of the proinﬂammatory cy-
tokines on CNS homeostasis. The inﬂammatory microenvi-
ronment of the CNS induces the activation of the microglia,
which also release proinﬂammatory cytokines and nitric ox-
ide [42]. Regulatory T cells play a crucial role in the control
of inﬂammation during EAE development [46–48]. Although
many cells with a regulatory phenotype have been described
in EAE (Tr1, Th3), the expression of the transcription fac-
tor Foxp3 seems to have a pivotal role in the activation of
immune suppression and, therefore, in the preservation of
immune homeostasis. The enhancement or transfer of regu-
latory cells normally abrogates the clinical signs of EAE and
other cell-based autoimmune diseases [49–51].

Since 1933, the EAE model has been useful to elucidate and
validate many mechanisms of multiple sclerosis. Moreover,
almost all available treatments for multiple sclerosis were
developed or tested in the EAE model.

2

The search for biomarkers

2.1 Biological samples

Choosing the proper biological sample is a crucial step in
identifying biomarker candidates that might be suitable for
clinical use. The blood is the ﬁrst and more obvious choice,
given that it is the most used type of sample for diagno-
sis and follow-up in clinical practice due to its accessibility
and minimally invasive collection procedure. However, sev-
eral drawbacks must be considered. Albumin and Igs consti-
tute approximately 75% of the total protein weight in blood
plasma/serum, and 20 additional proteins make up most of
the remaining weight. The other hundreds of low-abundance
proteins account for only approximately 1% of the protein
weight in plasma/serum [52]. The depletion of the most
abundant proteins is the standard solution employed in pro-
teomic studies, but we should always consider the possibility
that the depletion of these proteins might also deplete other
proteins that may be biomarker candidates [53]. Some au-
thors consider the blood a viable sample to detect CNS al-
terations when a disruption of the blood–brain barrier (BBB)
occurs [54], but such disruptions do not always occur in mul-
tiple sclerosis patients. Furthermore, there are not many CNS
proteins that are detectable in the blood. However, as an in-
ﬂammatory disease, the basis of multiple sclerosis depends
on cells and humoral factors that are produced in peripheral
immune organs and released into the blood. Nevertheless, all
studies concerning the identiﬁcation of potential biomark-
ers based on immunological features have failed to identify
speciﬁc markers. As a multifactorial disorder, multiple scle-
rosis likely involves a set of differentially expressed proteins
and genes rather than one particular marker. These proteins,
if analyzed in a multifactorial manner, might be useful in

combination for prognostic, diagnostic, or patient stratiﬁca-
tion goals.

The CSF is a clear ﬂuid present in the subarachnoid space,
which surrounds the CNS. CSF is present in the intracerebral
space of the ventricular system and the spinal cord and ﬂows
in a unidirectional manner [55]. The CSF is an ideal sample
type for identifying modiﬁcations in the CNS and is there-
fore an interesting source of biomarker candidates. Notably,
CSF proteomic data must be carefully evaluated because an
increased level of a speciﬁc protein may not be related directly
to increased expression in the brain tissue but could be due
to the degeneration of the CNS tissue, which can also be a
biomarker. The major drawback of employing CSF as the bi-
ological ﬂuid for clinical applications is the invasive nature of
its collection. Furthermore, depletion of high-abundance pro-
teins, such as albumin, IgG, transferrin, and transthyretin,
should also be performed prior to the proteomic analysis of
CSF.

Because multiple sclerosis is a brain disorder, the CNS
tissue would be the ideal tissue for discovering biomarkers.
However, the impossibility of collecting such tissue from liv-
ing patients prevents using CNS tissue markers. Despite this
limitation, CNS tissue is still a rich source of information
for better understanding and characterizing the pathobiology
of multiple sclerosis. With this aim, CNS tissues from post-
mortem human samples and EAE models have been investi-
gated by proteomic techniques and cross-compared with the
CSF and serum results. Eventually, the CNS results may be ex-
trapolated to the peripheral tissue in the search for biomarker
candidates.

2.2 Biomarkers for multiple sclerosis

Currently, there are no established molecular biomarkers for
multiple sclerosis. The diagnosis of this disease is based on
many criteria that are not unique to multiple sclerosis and
are also associated with other neurological and/or inﬂamma-
tory pathologies. The current diagnostic criteria for multiple
sclerosis include clinical and laboratorial features as well as
magnetic resonance image ﬁndings. Although the latest di-
agnostic criteria review excludes the analysis of CSF param-
eters [56, 57], oligoclonal bands (OCBs), which are present
in the CSF of a high percentage (∼90%) of multiple sclero-
sis patients, are the best parameter to conﬁrm the diagno-
sis [58]. OCBs are not speciﬁc to multiple sclerosis, being
present in patients with other neurological and inﬂamma-
tory diseases or even healthy individuals without neurologi-
cal conditions [59–61]. OCBs are a result of the intrathecal
synthesis of IgG. OCBs remain constant during the evo-
lution of the disease. Treatments such as immunomodula-
tors, rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies), and im-
munosuppression and even complete bone marrow ablation
do not modify the pattern of OCBs. The only evidence of
the disappearance of OCBs in the CSF was obtained when
the patients were treated with natalizumab [62]. Yet, there

tiple sclerosis and EAE.

are a number of autoantibodies, primarily against myelin
compounds, that can be found either in the serum or the CSF
(or both) of multiple sclerosis patients. These autoantibodies
include anti-MBP, anti-MOG, anti-PLP, anti-MAG, and anti-
HSP60 [63]. However, these autoantibodies are also present
in patients with other neurological and non-neurological dis-
eases [64, 65]. Therefore, proteomic studies would also help
identify protein biomarkers that can be used to monitor treat-
ment efﬁcacy and disease evolution.

Proteomic studies using multiple
sclerosis and EAE tissues

3.1 Methodologies

Among the articles considered in this review, half of them
used 2DE-MS as the central methodology of the study
(Fig. 1A). 2DE has been the basis of proteomics since its
beginning, but for large-scale proteomic comparisons, 2DE
has been progressively replaced by shotgun proteomics tech-
niques. These methodologies tend to be more sensitive and
reproducible and are automated, although the bias toward
the most highly expressed proteins remains for several of
the shotgun approaches [66]. In addition, it is important to
highlight the fact that, rather than being an outdated method,

C⃝ 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

Proteomics 2014, 14, 467–480

2DE is actually better suited to answer more speciﬁc questions
[67].

Multiple sclerosis research is also following the trends in
proteomics, with 22% of the studies using shotgun-MS se-
tups. An underrepresented technique that tends to be com-
mon is SRM/MRM; this technique was used in only one
out of the 18 studies reviewed herein. SRM/MRM is a piv-
otal technique, especially for the identiﬁcation of biomark-
ers. Additionally, large-scale analyses of PTMs—for example,
phosphoproteomics—have not yet been performed.

3.2 Differentially expressed proteins in multiple

sclerosis and EAE

In Table 1, we summarize the proteins that were found
to be differentially expressed in all proteomic studies per-
formed using multiple sclerosis and EAE tissues. These
proteins were classiﬁed according to their biological pro-
cesses using the Human Proteome Reference Database
(http://www.hprd.org). Proteins related to cell commu-
nication and signaling,
immune responses and protein
metabolism are the most represented (Fig. 1B). These data
reinforce the inﬂammatory pattern of the disease. Moreover,
the majority of differentially regulated proteins are involved
in protein metabolism, cell growth and maintenance and cell
communication and signaling, which indicates that there is
massive disruption of CNS homeostasis. The disruption of
CNS homeostasis is most likely a result of the inﬂammatory
process, which leads to the demyelination and neurodegen-
eration in the CNS.

3.3 Inﬂammation-related proteins

Inﬂammation in the CNS and demyelination are the main
characteristics of multiple sclerosis. Therefore, the regula-
tion of inﬂammation-related proteins could reveal speciﬁc
features of the disease, especially in the CNS.

The classical humoral inﬂammatory agents, such as cy-
tokines, Igs and complement, are the primary candidates
for differential expression during the inﬂammatory process
associated with multiple sclerosis. However, most of these
proteins are responsible for the classical inﬂammatory pro-
cesses in any inﬂammatory condition. Thus, there is constant
ﬂuctuation of these markers that could be related to any in-
ﬂammatory process and not necessarily multiple sclerosis.
Moreover, during the course of the disease in patients with
RRMS, there may be moments of clinical and inﬂamma-
tory silence. However, theoretically, the CNS is an immune-
privileged site. Thus, none of the classical immunological
players may be present. Therefore, the presence of classical
inﬂammatory mediators in the CNS could represent impor-
tant evidence of the inﬂammatory process taking place in-
side the CNS. Indeed, studies based on gene expression and
single-nucleotide polymorphism have shown major participa-

471

tion of genes involved in inﬂammatory processes [5]. It must
be noted that several inﬂammatory proteins, such as inter-
leukins, are present in low abundances and are often poorly
identiﬁed by proteomic techniques [68] due to the bias toward
the most abundant proteins, especially when using 2DE and
DDA-shotgun-MS. Moreover, because there is a disruption
of the BBB, the identiﬁcation of differentially expressed pro-
teins could be a result of the entrance of peripheral blood cells
into the CNS. Indeed, almost all published proteomics-based
analyses of CNS tissue or CSF, either from multiple sclerosis
patients or EAE model animals, have shown an upregulation
of serum albumin, suggestive of BBB disruption.

In addition to the increase in serum albumin, there have
been consistent reports of complement (C1q, C3, C4, and C9)
proteins in the CNS tissue and CSF, both in multiple sclerosis
patients and EAE model animals (Table 1). The complement
system is made up of a number of proteins that participate in
the opsonization of target cells. This opsonization enhances
phagocytosis or produces a transmembrane channel, which
causes an osmotic disturbance in the target cell and results
in cell death [69]. Many studies have found the increased
presence of prostaglandins (PGE2, PGD2) in the CSF and
CNS tissue (Table 1). Prostaglandins are one of the cardinal
signs of acute inﬂammation and play a crucial role in the
inﬂammatory response [70]. Corroborating the inﬂammatory
conditions in the CNS, some authors have shown an upregu-
lation of ␤2-microglobulin, which is a subunit of MHC-I. The
expression of MHC-I (HLA class I molecules in humans) is
stimulated by inﬂammatory conditions, primarily in the pres-
ence of proinﬂammatory cytokines such as IFN-␥ [71]. There
are consistent reports of Ig chains. The presence of Ig may
also be related to BBB disruption. However, it is possible that
at least some of the Ig present is produced intrathecally, as has
already been reported for multiple sclerosis patients [72, 73].
Although the presence of autoantibodies is consistent in the
serum and CSF of multiple sclerosis patients, it is not yet clear
if the autoantibody pattern characterizes the unique pathol-
ogy of multiple sclerosis or its forms [74].

Interestingly, many authors have observed the upregula-
tion of apolipoprotein (APO) isoforms (Table 1). APOs have
also been shown to be associated with an increased risk of
Alzheimer’s disease [75]. Although APOs have an impor-
tant role in the maintenance and repair of neurons [76], re-
cent data suggest that these proteins may have fundamen-
tal immunomodulatory roles, primarily through microglia
and/or macrophage release [77]. ApoE-knockout mice exhibit
an important increase in the levels of pro-inﬂammatory cy-
tokines [78]. Therefore, the increase in the expression of APO
isoforms may be related to the feedback response to the
inﬂammatory process. Interestingly, proteins involved in
phagocytosis and exocytosis, such as annexin 1–5 and
coronin-1A, are upregulated [79, 80]. These proteins might
be directly related to the presence and the activity of proin-
ﬂammatory cells inside the CNS.

There are a considerable number of proteins directly re-
lated to the inﬂammatory response. The presence of these

proteins is consistent in the literature and is a clear indicator
of the inﬂammatory activity of the disease, especially when
they are found in the CSF and/or CNS tissue.

3.4 Neurodegeneration-related proteins

The majority of the differentially expressed proteins described
in multiple sclerosis tissues are somehow related to the neu-
rodegenerative process of the disease. The most frequently
reported change in regulation in multiple sclerosis patients or
EAE models is related to structural ﬁlaments, especially neu-
roﬁlaments (Table 1). The downregulation of neuroﬁlaments
in the CNS tissue or upregulation in the CSF is indicative of
a neurodegenerative process [81]. Many studies have found
an upregulation of glial ﬁbrillary acid protein (GFAP). GFAP
is an intermediary ﬁlament that is mainly expressed by as-
trocytes. The upregulation of GFAP is most likely a result of
glial scarring as a consequence of the neurodegenerative pro-
cess [82, 83]. In addition to the structural disturbance, there
is also a large number of differentially expressed proteins
associated with cellular metabolism, indicative of the dereg-
ulation of the homeostatic state of CNS cells, which is most
likely related to the inﬂammation in the CNS. In addition,
proteins with enzymatic properties, such as calpain-3, met-
alloproteinases, alpha-enolase, proteinase activator complex,
are upregulated. These enzymes might be directly related to
the neurodegenerative process. It is not yet clear how these
enzymes act during the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis.
However, many of these enzymes have already reported to be
associated with other neurodegenerative diseases [84–87]. In-
terestingly, some authors have shown that a potassium chan-
nel is deregulated (Table 1). In a recent work, researchers
reported on a group of multiple sclerosis patients in which
a potassium channel was an autoantigen [88]. Proteomics-
based studies have provided an important contribution to
conﬁrm an early neurodegenerative process during multiple
sclerosis. The neurodegenerative process was thought to oc-
cur after the initial inﬂammatory response. However, today it
is clear that both processes are linked starting from the early
stage of the disease [3].

Conclusion

Despite the large number of studies that have been aimed
to identify biomarkers for multiple sclerosis during the last
10 years, we have not found any reliable protein biomark-
ers. However, these studies have found many potential can-
didates. Differentially expressed proteins may be helpful to
better understand the pathobiology of the disease. Indeed,
the entire therapeutic armory for multiple sclerosis is based
on the immunologic aspects of the disease, and there is not
a single drug targeting the neurodegenerative aspect. There-
fore, the differentially expressed proteins identiﬁed by several
studies may be essential to ﬁnd new targets and/or monitor

current and new treatments. Moreover, studies have demon-
strated the importance of CSF studies, which were excluded
from the latest revision of the diagnosis criteria.

The quest for biomarkers of multiple sclerosis may be
more complex than those for other neurodegenerative or
inﬂammatory diseases. Due to the combination of inﬂamma-
tory and neurodegenerative components, multiple sclerosis
will not have a single biomarker but a group of differentially
expressed proteins that together might be used to distinguish
the unique pathology of multiple sclerosis.

The proteomics-based analysis of multiple sclerosis pa-
tients and experimental models over the past 10 years has pro-
vided an ocean of data but no certainty. We suggest that these
data must be considered as the fundamental basis for fur-
ther studies, perhaps in a more targeted manner. In addition,
state-of-the-art proteomic technologies must be employed, in-
cluding the analysis of proteins PTM, protein–protein inter-
action, and strategies that can drive basic scientiﬁc ﬁndings
closer to the bedside [89]. Although we still have in multiple
sclerosis research a long road to travel ahead of us, proteomics
has helped to pave it better.

The authors have declared no conﬂict of interest.
