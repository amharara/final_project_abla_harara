Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive neurological disorder associated with myelin destruction and neurodegeneration. Oligodendro-
cyte precursor cells (OPCs) present in demyelinated lesions gradually fail to differentiate properly, so remyelination becomes incomplete.
Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z (PTPRZ), one of the most abundant protein tyrosine phosphatases expressed in OPCs, is
known to suppress oligodendrocyte differentiation and maintain their precursor cell stage. In the present study, we examined the in vivo
mechanisms for remyelination using a cuprizone-induced demyelination model. Ptprz-deficient and wild-type mice both exhibited
severe demyelination and axonal damage in the corpus callosum after cuprizone feeding. The similar accumulation of OPCs was observed
in the lesioned area in both mice; however, remyelination was significantly accelerated in Ptprz-deficient mice after the removal of
cuprizone. After demyelination, the expression of pleiotrophin (PTN), an inhibitory ligand for PTPRZ, was transiently increased in
mouse brains, particularly in the neurons involved, suggesting its role in promoting remyelination by inactivating PTPRZ activity. In
support of this view, oligodendrocyte differentiation was augmented in a primary culture of oligodendrocyte-lineage cells from wild-type
mice in response to PTN. In contrast, these cells from Ptprz-deficient mice showed higher oligodendrocyte differentiation without PTN
and differentiation was not enhanced by its addition. We further demonstrated that PTN treatment increased the tyrosine phosphoryla-
tion of p190 RhoGAP, a PTPRZ substrate, using an established line of OPCs. Therefore, PTPRZ inactivation in OPCs by PTN, which is
secreted from demyelinated axons, may be the mechanism responsible for oligodendrocyte differentiation during reparative remyelina-
tion in the CNS.

Significance Statement
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the CNS that destroys myelin, the insulation that surrounds axons. Associ-
ated damages to oligodendrocytes (the cells that produce myelin) and nerve fibers produce neurological disability. Most patients
with MS have an initial relapsing-remitting course for 5–15 years. Remyelination during the early stages of the disease process has
been documented; however, the molecular mechanism underlying remyelination has not been understood. Protein tyrosine
phosphatase receptor type Z (PTPRZ) is a receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase preferentially expressed in the CNS. This
study shows that pleiotrophin, an inhibitory ligand for PTPRZ, is transiently expressed and released from demyelinated neurons
to inactivate PTPRZ in oligodendrocyte precursor cells present in the lesioned part, thereby allowing their differentiation for
remyelination.

Introduction
Myelination is an essential feature of the vertebrate nervous
system that provides electrical insulation to axons, thereby facil-
itating the transmission of nerve impulses. Deficiencies in myeli-
nation in diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) lead to serious
neurological disorders (Frohman et al., 2006). Most MS patients
initially exhibit a relapsing-remitting disease course that eventu-
ally converts to a secondary progressive form of the disease with
incomplete recovery. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs),
the principal source of myelinating oligodendrocytes (Goldman
et al., 2012), differentiate to myelinate demyelinated axons again
(remyelination) during remitting stages (Chang et al., 2002).
Two animal disease models are widely accepted for studying the
clinical and pathological features of MS lesions. Experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a T-cell-mediated in-
flammatory CNS demyelination model that is generated by im-
munization with the myelin/oligodendrocyte glycoprotein
(MOG) (Høglund and Maghazachi, 2014). On the other hand,
the cuprizone model of demyelination is induced, particularly in
the corpus callosum in the CNS, by a T-cell-independent mech-
anism through feeding with the copper chelator cuprizone (Mat-
sushima and Morell, 2001).

Previous studies identified protein tyrosine phosphorylation
as a key event in oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin for-
mation (Kra¨mer-Albers and White, 2011). The tyrosine phos-
phorylation of cellular proteins is controlled by the activities of
protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and protein tyrosine phospha-
tases (PTPs). FYN tyrosine kinase signaling is a major pathway
for oligodendrocyte differentiation, myelination, and remyelina-
tion (Umemori et al., 1994, 1999; Scarlato et al., 2000), whereas
our knowledge regarding the functional role and regulatory
mechanism of PTPs in these processes is limited.

PTPRZ [also called PTP␨or receptor-like PTP␤(RPTP␤)] is
an RPTP that is predominantly expressed in the CNS (Maeda et
al., 1994). Three isoforms have been generated by alternative
splicing from a single PTPRZ gene: two transmembrane iso-
forms, PTPRZ-A and PTPRZ-B, and the secretory isoform
PTPRZ-S (also known as phosphacan) (Maeda et al., 1994; Chow
et al., 2008a). All three isoforms expressed in the CNS were shown
to be highly glycosylated by chondroitin sulfate (Nishiwaki et al.,
1998; Chow et al., 2008b; Kuboyama et al., 2012). The extracel-
lular region of PTPRZ binds pleiotrophin (PTN)/heparin-
binding growth-associated molecule (HB-GAM) (Maeda et al.,
1996), midkine (Maeda et al., 1999), and IL-34 (Nandi et al.,
2013) as its inhibitory ligands. PTN binding leads to inactivation
of the intracellular catalytic activity of PTPRZ by inducing recep-

tor dimerization or oligomerization (Meng et al., 2000; Kawachi
et al., 2001; Fukada et al., 2006).

We recently demonstrated that PTPRZ functioned conversely
to FYN tyrosine kinase in oligodendrocyte-lineage cells and neg-
atively regulated the differentiation of oligodendrocytes and my-
elin formation in vivo (Kuboyama et al., 2012). The knock-out of
Ptprz does not cause any gross anatomical abnormality in mice
(Shintani et al., 1998), whereas adult Ptprz-deficient mice are
markedly resistant to the MOG-mediated induction of EAE
(Kuboyama et al., 2012). p190 RhoGAP, a GTPase-activating
protein (GAP) for Rho GTPase, is one of the PTPRZ substrates in
neurons and glial cells (Fukada et al., 2005; Tamura et al., 2006;
Fujikawa et al., 2011; Kuboyama et al., 2012). The tyrosine phos-
phorylation of p190 RhoGAP by FYN activates its Rho GTPase
activity (Wolf et al., 2001) and thereby induces oligodendrocyte
differentiation and myelination (Wolf et al., 2001; Kra¨mer-
Albers and White, 2011). Therefore, PTPRZ functions as a nega-
tive regulator of oligodendrocyte differentiation, myelination,
and remyelination (Kuboyama et al., 2012); however, the in vivo
regulatory mechanism of PTPRZ activity in oligodendrocyte-
lineage cells remains unclear.

In the present study, we found that Ptprz-deficient mice ex-
hibited accelerated remyelination in the corpus callosum after
cuprizone-induced demyelination. The expression of the inhibi-
tory PTPRZ ligand PTN was strongly induced in demyelinated
neurons. PTN-treated oligodendrocyte-lineage cells exhibited
enhanced differentiation due to the inhibition of PTPRZ. The
PTPRZ-mediated repression of oligodendrocyte differentiation
appears to be relieved by PTN secreted from demyelinated nerve
fibers for their remyelination.

brains were gently wiped to remove surface solution and then scanned on
a micro-CT system R_mCT2 (Rigaku) at 90 kV (160 ␮A) with a 20 mm
field of view. Data were reconstructed by OsiriX software (Pixmeo) and
the average CT numbers from two regions of interest (four adjacent
pixels) in the dorsal corpus callosum and cerebral cortex were recorded
for each image.

Luxol fast blue and immunohistochemical staining. After CT scanning,
the brains were immersed in 70% ethanol overnight and then subjected
to conventional paraffin embedding. Paraffin-embedded brains were se-
rially sectioned at 3 ␮m intervals in the coronal plane. Luxol fast blue
(LFB) staining of deparaffinized sections was performed with LFB stain
solution (catalog #4102; Muto Pure Chemicals). For immunohistochem-
istry, deparaffinized sections were pretreated with 3% hydrogen peroxide
and 0.04% NP-40 in TBS (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) for 30
min, blocked with 4% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Triton X-100 in TBS,
and then incubated with each specific primary antibody overnight at 4°C.
Sections for anti-APP, anti-PTN, anti-␤-tubulin III, or anti-SYN1 stain-

Culture of primary mixed glial cells and isolation of oligodendrocyte lin-
eage cells. A primary mixed glial cell culture was prepared from wild-type
and Ptprz-deficient mice as described previously (Kuboyama et al.,
2012). Brain cortex tissues were obtained from mice on postnatal day 1,
followed by papain digestion. Dissociated cells were cultured for 6 d on a
poly-L-ornithine-coated 35 mm dish (2.0 ⫻ 10 4 cells per dish) with
DMEM mixed 1:1 with Ham’s F-12 (DMEM/F12; Life Technologies)
supplemented with 1⫻ GlutaMAX (Life Technologies), 1⫻ N2 supple-
ment (Life Technologies), 10 ␮g/ml of the AA homodimeric form of
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-AA; Wako Pure Chemical), 0.5%
fetal bovine serum (Nichirei Biosciences), and 100 ␮g/ml of bovine se-
rum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich) in a humidified incubator at 37°C with
5% CO2. Cell differentiation was induced by the addition of 10 nM biotin
(Sigma-Aldrich) and 30 ng/ml thyronine/thyroxine (Sigma-Aldrich).
Recombinant human PTN produced in yeast was used as described pre-
viously (Murasugi et al., 2003; Fukada et al., 2005).

Mouse oligodendrocyte-lineage cells (OL1 cells) were established
from the primary mixed glial cell culture from p53-deficient mice that
have been used as a source of various cell lines (Tsukada et al., 1993).
After a 10 d culture, cells were removed with 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (Life

Immunocytochemistry. A fixative containing 4% paraformaldehyde
and 20% sucrose in PBS was added to dishes carefully so as not to detach
cells and fixation was allowed to proceed for 30 min. After permeabilizing
and blocking with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 4% nonfat dry milk in TBS, the
cells were incubated with the respective primary antibodies overnight at

cals) with 250 ␮l of lysis buffer for a 35 mm dish. After precleaning the
cell extracts with Protein G Sepharose (GE Healthcare), the immuno-
complexes with an anti-p190 RhoGAP antibody (2 ␮l) were precipitated
using Protein G Sepharose (20 ␮l beads volume) and eluted by boiling in
a SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE fol-
lowed by semidry electroblotting onto a polyvinylidene difluoride mem-
brane. The membrane was incubated with 4% nonfat dry milk and 0.1%
Triton X-100 in TBS and then reacted overnight with the respective

Forte Western HRP Substrate (Millipore). To detect phosphorylated
proteins, the membranes were blocked with 1% BSA and 0.1% Triton
X-100 in TBS and then incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-phospho-
Tyr mAb or rabbit anti-pY1105 antibodies. Densitometry analyses were

Ptprz-deficient mice also exhibited a sim-

zone feeding (Fig. 1, 0 week). However,
reparative remyelination was more evi-
dent in Ptprz-deficient mice 1–3 weeks
after the removal of cuprizone than in

erated remyelination in Ptprz-deficient
mice.

plot for the wild-type showed that the CT number difference
between the corpus callosum and cortex significantly decreased

We confirmed the validity of this CT
assay by LFB myelin staining of tissue sec-
tions prepared from the same brains used
for the CT imaging. The results of LFB
staining (Fig. 2) were consistent with
those of CT imaging. The immunohisto-
chemical staining analysis indicated that
the recovery of MBP expression (remyeli-
nation) occurred earlier in Ptprz-deficient
mice than in wild-type mice (Fig. 3). The
remyelination of lesioned nerve fibers requires the recruit-
ment of OPCs to the lesion sites and their differentiation to
myelin-carrying mature oligodendrocytes (Frohman et al.,
2006). The number of oligodendrocyte-lineage cells (Olig2-
positive) recruited to the lesioned area showed a similar pattern
between the two genotypes (Fig. 4) in that Olig2-positive cells were
decreased by cuprizone feeding, but increased 1–3 weeks after the
removal of cuprizone and returned to normal levels by 5 weeks.
These results suggested that accelerated remyelination in Ptprz-
deficient mice was not induced by the enhanced recruitment of
OPCs, but by their higher differentiation potential.

Astroglial cells and neurons also express PTPRZ (Shintani et
al., 1998), so these cells may affect recovery from demyelinating
lesions. However, no significant differences were observed in the
accumulation of reactive astrocytes (GFAP-positive; Fig. 5) or the
number of injured axons (APP-positive; Fig. 6) between the two
genotypes. They gradually returned to normal levels in both ge-
notypes by returning to the normal diet with a similar time
course.

We then investigated by immunohistochemistry whether the
expression of endogenous PTPRZ ligands such as PTN, midkine,
and IL-34 were affected in lesions. The corpus callosum is a major
cortical– cortical fiber tract connecting the two cerebral hemi-
spheres (Jacobson and Trojanowski, 1974). PTN immunoreac-
tivity was markedly increased both in the corpus callosum and
the cortex after cuprizone-induced lesion (Fig. 7), but this grad-
ually disappeared within 3 weeks after returning to the normal
diet (Figs. 8, 9). On the other hand, we detected no changes in
midkine or IL-34 expression (Fig. 7). Double-staining experi-
ments revealed that PTN signals were present in the cortex neu-
rons (␤-tubulin III-positive; Fig. 10A) and the signals were
colocalized with a synaptic vesicle marker synapsin 1 (SYN1), not
only in the soma of cortex neurons (Fig. 10A), but also in axon
fibers in the corpus callosum (Fig. 10B). The PTN signals also
overlapped with APP signals in the corpus callosum (Fig. 10B),
indicating that PTN was transiently expressed in damaged neu-
rons and transported to demyelinated axons. Notably, the punc-
tate signals of PTN were not detected in Olig2-positive
oligodendrocyte-lineage cells or GFAP-positive astrocytes in the
corpus callosum (Fig. 10B). PTN is likely released from demyeli-
nated axonal fibers (see below).

We therefore investigated the potential role of PTN-PTPRZ
signaling in oligodendrocyte differentiation using a primary cul-
ture of mixed mouse glial cells (Kuboyama et al., 2012). The PTN
treatment alone did not induce oligodendrocyte maturation
(i.e., the expression of MBP) in wild-type glial cells (Fig. 11A);
however, PTN significantly enhanced the differentiation of
oligodendrocyte induced by thyroid hormone (TH) (Fig. 11B).
Ptprz-deficient glial cells showed higher differentiation activity
than wild-type cells with the TH treatment (Fig. 11B), as de-
scribed previously (Kuboyama et al., 2012); however, notably,
the differentiation was not further potentiated by the addition
of PTN (Fig. 11B).

Because the mixed glial culture apparently contains a heterol-
ogous cell population, we established oligodendrocyte-lineage
cells (OL1 cells) from the brains of p53-deficient mouse pups
(Fig. 12A) and used them in biochemical analyses of PTN-PTPRZ
signaling during differentiation. All OL1 cells were positive for an
OPC marker NG2 and they differentiated into MBP-positive ma-
ture oligodendrocytes when cultured with TH (Fig. 12B,C), in-
dicating that they exhibited normal differentiation properties.
OL1 cells were strongly positive for the two receptor isoforms of
PTPRZ-A and PTPRZ-B with chondroitin sulfate chains,
whereas only PTPRZ-B was weakly detectable after differentia-
tion (Fig. 12D,E).

Immunocytochemistry showed that the PTN treatment ex-
pectedly enhanced the TH-induced differentiation of OL1 cells
(Fig. 13A), as observed in the primary mixed glial culture (Fig.
11). Western blotting of OL1 cells also showed that PTN in-
creased TH-induced MBP expression. The amount of NG2 pro-
tein was decreased by PTN independently of TH (Fig. 13B),
suggesting that PTN has an activity to release PTPRZ-mediated
blockage of OPC differentiation. It is known that p190 RhoGAP
is primarily phosphorylated at Tyr-1105 by FYN tyrosine kinase

in OPCs, thereby inducing differentiation into oligodendrocytes
(Umemori et al., 1994; Wolf et al., 2001). However, phospho-
Tyr-1105 in p190 RhoGAP is maintained at low levels by dephos-
phorylation by PTPRZ (Fukada et al., 2005; Tamura et al., 2006;
Kuboyama et al., 2012). The phosphorylation of p190 RhoGAP at
Tyr-1105 was enhanced in PTN-treated OL1 cells because of the
inactivation of PTPRZ by PTN (Fig. 13C,D). It was concluded
that the catalytic activity of PTPRZ receptor isoforms function to
maintain OPCs in an undifferentiated state and PTN-induced
inactivation of PTPRZ releases this blockage, thereby allowing for
remyelination.
Discussion
MS is an inflammatory (immune)-mediated demyelinating dis-
ease of the human CNS. In the present study, we induced demy-
elination in the CNS with cuprizone and demonstrated that a
Ptprz deficiency accelerated CNS remyelination after cuprizone-
induced demyelination. In the lesioned area, transient expression
of PTN was detected in demyelinated nerves. Extracellular PTN

mice (Kuboyama et al., 2012) suggested
that a Ptprz deficiency was responsible for
reduced demyelination, increased remy-
elination, or both. Although EAE is the
most common animal model of MS, it is
difficult to estimate the role of PTPRZ in
remyelination itself because EAE is an
immune-mediated demyelinating model
(Høglund and Maghazachi, 2014). There-
fore, we herein adopted a cuprizone
model.

The feeding of toxic cuprizone has
been shown to cause reproducible demy-
elination by a nonautoimmune mecha-
nism in the corpus callosum (Matsushima
and Morell, 2001). Ptprz-deficient mice,
as well as wild-type mice, developed se-
vere demyelination in the corpus callo-
sum and axonal damage due to cuprizone
(Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), indicating that a
Ptprz deficiency does not affect demyeli-
nation itself. Conversely, remyelination
was accelerated in Ptprz-deficient mice af-
ter the removal of cuprizone (Figs. 1, 2, 3),
which is consistent with our previous
finding that PTPRZ is a negative regula-
tor of oligodendrocyte differentiation
(Kuboyama et al., 2012). No significant
differences were observed in the accumu-
lation of OPCs in the lesioned area (Fig.
4). These results indicate that the acceler-
ation of remyelination in the Ptprz-
deficient mouse was induced by a high
differentiation ability of OPCs.

The functional

mechanism of RPTPs has not been inves-
tigated as extensively as that of PTKs. PT-
PRZ is the first RPTP molecule in that its
soluble extracellular ligands and intracel-
lular substrate proteins have been identi-
fied as a set (Kawachi et al., 2001; Fukada
et al., 2005, 2006). Although growth fac-
tors such as PTN, midkine, and IL-34 have been identified as
endogenous inhibitory ligands for PTPRZ (Maeda et al., 1996,
1999; Kawachi et al., 2001; Fukada et al., 2006; Nandi et al., 2013),
the in vivo significance of these ligand-receptor pairs has re-
mained unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated acceler-
ated remyelination in Ptprz-deficient mice (Figs. 1, 2, 3) and the
transient
induction of PTN in damaged neurons in the
cuprizone-induced demyelination model (Figs. 7, 8, 9). PTN sig-
nals in axons in the corpus callosum were overlapped with the
synaptic marker SYN1 and the damaged axon marker APP. APP
is known to be packed into axonal vesicles that undergo kinesin
1-dependent anterograde movement along microtubules in ax-
ons (Amaratunga et al., 1995a, 1995b; Kaether et al., 2000).

Two groups previously reported the existence of vesicular glu-
tamate release at axonal membranes in the corpus callosum and
the optic nerve, suggesting that this process may be widespread in
white matter (Kukley et al., 2007; Ziskin et al., 2007). The axonal
release involves highly localized calcium microdomain signaling,
similar to vesicle fusion at synapses (Kukley et al., 2007). Here,
unmyelinated fibers are reportedly responsible for the signaling
with NG2-positive glia (Ziskin et al., 2007). Although the mech-

inhibited PTPRZ activity in OPCs and thus promoted their dif-
ferentiation. The PTN-induced inactivation of PTPRZ was con-
sidered to be the adaptive mechanism underlying CNS
remyelination in vivo.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of p190 RhoGAP by Fyn is a main
signaling pathway
involved in differentiation of OPCs
to oligodendrocytes (Kra¨mer-Albers and White, 2011). A 50%
decrease in myelination has been reported in Fyn-knock-out
mice (Umemori et al., 1994). p190 RhoGAP is a common crucial
target for FYN (Wolf et al., 2001) and PTPRZ (Kuboyama et al., 2012)
in oligodendrocyte-lineage cells. We recently reported that PTPRZ
negatively regulates the differentiation of oligodendrocytes and
myelin formation (Kuboyama et al., 2012) as a phosphatase that
functions conversely to FYN tyrosine kinase. Ptprz-deficient mice
showed the early onset of myelination in the developing brain,
whereas the myelin sheath in the adult brain appears to be normal
(Kuboyama et al., 2012). Moreover, adult Ptprz-deficient mice
were less susceptible to EAE induced by active immunization
with a MOG peptide than wild-type mice (Kuboyama et al.,
2012). The enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of p190 RhoGAP
and the reduced loss of MBP in the EAE model of Ptprz-deficient

anism of PTN secretion along the axon is
not clear, our results suggest that PTN is
thus released from demyelinated axons
and inactivates the PTPRZ of OPCs in the
lesioned area to achieve their differentia-
tion and remyelination.

In a primary culture, PTN significantly
enhanced TH-induced oligodendrocyte
differentiation in wild-type cells, although
PTN alone did not induce maturation
(Fig. 11). In contrast, Ptprz-deficient glial
cells showed higher TH-induced differen-
tiation ability without PTN (Fig. 11); im-
portantly, it was at similar levels to those
of wild-type cells with PTN. These find-
ings were essentially consistent with the in
vivo results that the recovery of MBP ex-
pression was
accelerated in Ptprz-
deficient mice (Fig. 3). PTN-PTPRZ
signaling is therefore considered to con-
tribute to remyelination by enhancing
OPC differentiation in vivo. Although we
found no significant changes in the total
number of oligodendrocyte-lineage cells
(NG2-positive cells plus MBP-positive
cells) after PTN treatment in the primary
culture (Fig. 11), PTN was previously re-
ported to contribute to the homeostatic
self-renewal of human PDGFR␣-sorted
OPCs in culture (McClain et al., 2012).

We established a source of pure
oligodendrocyte-lineage OL1 cells from
the p53-deficient newborn mouse brain to
determine the intracellular signaling pathways involved in OPC
differentiation. The established OL1 cells maintained a normal
differentiation ability and PTN sensitivity, similar to wild-type
OPCs, in the primary culture (Figs. 12, 13). PTN increased the
phosphorylation of the substrate molecules of PTPRZ, such as
p190 RhoGAP, in OL1 cells (Fig. 13D), indicating the involve-
ment of PTN-PTPRZ signaling mechanism in OPC differentia-
tion. PTPRZ-A and PTPRZ-B isoforms were both expressed in
OL1 cells in the immature state as chondroitin sulfate proteogly-
cans, whereas only PTPRZ-B proteins were weakly detectable
after differentiation (Fig. 12D,E), which was very similar to the
expression profiles of the receptor isoforms observed during the
normal development of rodent brains (Nishiwaki et al., 1998).
Together, these results demonstrated that PTPRZ receptors were
required to maintain OPCs in the immature state and its ligand-
induced inactivationreleasedthisblockage,therebypromoting oligo-
dendrocyte differentiation and remyelination (Fig. 14). This
PTN-PTPRZ signaling may be also involved in the oligodendro-
cyte differentiation during normal development.

Despite the effectiveness of current therapies in controlling
CNS inflammation in patients with MS, none prevents the
chronic progressive process (Høglund and Maghazachi, 2014).
Because OPCs are still present in the demyelinated regions of MS
patients yet fail to differentiate, the development of therapeutic
compounds is anticipated to enhance remyelination from this
quiescent OPC population (Chang et al., 2002). The rationale for
this concept has been already demonstrated by improving clinical
outcomes in demyelination mouse models with several agents to
promote OPC differentiation, such as: an antagonist antibody for
LINGO-1 that is a negative regulator of FYN kinase in OPCs (Mi

achieving the high-affinity binding of PTN to the core protein (Maeda et al., 1996). PTPRZ activity is requisite to maintaining the
immature state of OPCs. After cuprizone-induced oligodendrocyte death and demyelination, the expression of PTN is transiently
upregulated in damaged neurons. PTN may be released from demyelinated axons and bind to PTPRZ at the cell surface of OPCs that
are recruited to lesions, probably through PTPRZ-independent mechanisms. The binding of PTN results in receptor dimerization or
oligomerization, thereby inhibiting its catalytic activity (Fukada et al., 2006). PTPRZ inactivation releases the block of differentia-
tion in OPCs, so the remyelination of neighboring axons is initiated.

et al., 2005, 2007); benztropine, which depends on muscarinic
receptor antagonism (Deshmukh et al., 2013); and miconazole
via unknown targets (Najm et al., 2015). We detected no signifi-
cant PTPRZ inhibition by miconazole in vitro (data not shown).
Therefore, inhibitory ligands for PTPRZ may also be effective in the
treatment of demyelinated lesions; however, midkine reportedly
triggers relapses of EAE by increasing the number of autoreactive
T-helper cells (Wang et al., 2008; Sonobe et al., 2012). Because the
expression of PTPRZ is not detectable in T cells (Kuboyama et al.,
2012), other midkine (and PTN) receptors, such as anaplastic lym-
phoma kinase, integrins, or low-density lipoprotein receptor-related
proteins, may be involved in this event (Kadomatsu et al., 2013). We
propose the development of selective inhibitors for the catalytic PTP
domain of PTPRZ as a plausible and effective therapeutic strategy for
demyelinating diseases.
