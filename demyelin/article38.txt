Alemtuzumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against human CD52, is used in the treatment of MS. To charac-
terize the impact of anti-CD52 administration, a monoclonal antibody to mouse CD52 (anti-muCD52) was gen-
erated and evaluated in EAE mouse models of MS. A single course of anti-muCD52 provided a therapeutic beneﬁt
accompanied by a reduction in the frequency of autoreactive T lymphocytes and production of pro-inﬂammatory
cytokines. Examination of the CNS revealed a decrease in inﬁltrating lymphocytes, demyelination and axonal loss.
Electrophysiological assessment showed preservation of axonal conductance in the spinal cord. These ﬁndings
suggest that anti-CD52 therapy may help preserve CNS integrity.

1. Introduction

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, autoimmune disorder of the
central nervous system (CNS) leading to demyelination and associated
neurological symptoms.

The exact etiology of MS remains unclear but is generally believed to
involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors that lead to
the development of CNS autoimmunity and progression of disease in
susceptible individuals. Experimental and clinical data suggest that in
MS, peripheral activation of T cells reactive against CNS antigens results
in upregulation of adhesion molecules and ability of the T cells to cross
the blood–brain barrier. Once in the CNS, autoreactive T cells are activat-
ed locally by CNS antigens and cause inﬂammation and damage through
the release of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines that recruit
and activate other effector cells (e.g. macrophages) (Friese et al., 2014).
B lymphocytes are also postulated to participate in disease pathogenesis
through the production of autoantibodies, presentation of CNS antigens
to T lymphocytes and/or production of cytokines (Krumbholz et al.,

encephalomyelitis; mu, murine; SMEP, spinal motor evoked potential.

2012). But perhaps the strongest evidence for a pathogenic role of lym-
phocytes in MS is the observed efﬁcacy of disease-modifying therapies
targeted at T and/or B cells.

Over the past few years, a number of therapies designed to inhibit
the proliferation, function or migration of T lymphocytes have been ap-
proved for the treatment of RRMS (Ransohoff et al., 2015). Recent clin-
ical trial data with B cell depleting agents (rituximab, ocrelizumab) also
suggest that targeting B lymphocytes may provide a clinical beneﬁt thus
supporting a role of B lymphocytes in MS disease pathogenesis
(Castillo-Trivino et al., 2013). Alemtuzumab, a humanized monoclonal
antibody that targets both T and B lymphocytes was recently approved
in over 40 countries. Alemtuzumab is speciﬁc for CD52, an antigen pres-
ent at high levels on the surface of T and B lymphocytes and at lower
levels on other immune cells (Hale et al., 1990; Rao et al., 2012). Pivotal
phase 3 trials conducted in treatment-naïve relapsing–remitting
(RRMS) patients (CARE-MS I) and in RRMS patients who relapsed on
prior therapy (CARE-MS II) indicated that alemtuzumab administered
as two annual courses of treatment (12 mg intravenously on 5 consec-
utive days at study start and 3 days a year later) provided superior efﬁ-
cacy compared to interferon-β1a (IFN-β1a) administered three times
per week (44 μg subcutaneously) (Cohen et al., 2012; Coles et al.,
2012a). In addition, long-term follow-up of patients from a phase 2
study (CAMMS223) suggested that alemtuzumab provides a durable

beneﬁt as it lowered the risk of sustained accumulation of disability by
72% and the rate of relapse by 69% compared to IFNβ-1a out to 4 years
after the last alemtuzumab treatment (Coles et al., 2012b). The mecha-
nism by which alemtuzumab exerts its therapeutic effect in MS is not
fully understood but may involve rebalancing of the immune system
through the depletion and repopulation of lymphocytes. In clinical stud-
ies, the administration of alemtuzumab results in rapid depletion of
lymphocytes from the circulation which may reduce the inﬂammatory
processes associated with MS (Cox et al., 2005; Thompson et al.,
2010). This is followed by a prolonged period of lymphocyte repopula-
tion and clinical research ﬁndings suggest that the number, proportions
and properties of lymphocyte subsets are altered during the repopula-
tion process. An enrichment in regulatory T (Treg) cells as well as a
shift in the CD4+ T cell cytokine proﬁle, characterized by a decrease in
the production of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines and an increase in anti-
inﬂammatory cytokines, have been observed in repopulating lympho-
cytes post-alemtuzumab (Cox et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2013). Such
changes may lead to a rebalancing of the immune system that persists
long after clearance of the antibody and which may contribute to the
observed long-lived therapeutic beneﬁt in MS patients.

While studies in MS patients have allowed characterization of the
impact of alemtuzumab on blood lymphocyte populations and on CNS
parameters via imaging, mouse models afford the opportunity to collect
tissues not accessible in humans and allow for the conduct of additional
in vivo assays to further our understanding of the mechanism of action
and effects of anti-CD52 treatment. In previous studies, we took advan-
tage of the ability to perform immunological challenges and collect lym-
phoid organs in the mouse to conduct an in-depth characterization of
the functionality of the immune system following treatment with
anti-CD52 (Hu et al., 2009; Turner et al., 2013). In the current studies,
the impact of anti-CD52 therapy was evaluated in mouse models of ex-
perimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) with a particular
focus on the CNS compartment.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Anti-mouse CD52 monoclonal antibody

Anti-mouse CD52 (muCD52) monoclonal antibodies were generat-
ed by immunizing human CD52 knock-in/murine CD52 knockout
mice. Animals received three subcutaneous (s.c.) immunizations with
a muCD52 peptide (GQATTAASGTNKNSTSTKKTPLKS) conjugated to
keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) emulsiﬁed in Titermax Gold
(Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO) followed by intraperitoneal (i.p.) immu-
nization with wild type C57BL/6 mouse splenocytes as a source of natu-
rally occurring CD52. Four days prior to the collection of spleen cells,
animals were rechallenged i.p. with muCD52-KLH peptide and the fol-
lowing day with the same peptide-KLH intravenously (i.v.). Spleen
cells were fused to SP0/2 cells to generate monoclonal antibodies,
serum titers assessed by peptide and/or muCD52 fusion protein-based
ELISA, and clones screened for muCD52 speciﬁcity by ﬂow cytometry.
The characteristics of the clone selected for these studies are described
in Section 3.1.

2.2. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse models

All experimental procedures were approved by and performed in ac-
cordance with the Genzyme Institutional Animals Care and Use Commit-
tee (IACUC) and conducted in Genzyme's Association for Assessment and
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC)-accredited facility.
EAE was induced by immunizing C57BL/6ByJ and SJLByJ mice (Jackson
Laboratories Bar Harbor, ME) s.c. with 200 μg of MOG35–55, MOG1–121, or
PLP131–153 peptides emulsiﬁed in complete Freund's adjuvant (Chondrex,
Redmond, WA) containing 4 mg/ml Mycobacterium tuberculosis
(Stromnes and Goverman, 2006). Pertussis toxin (200 ng: Sigma-
Aldrich; St. Louis, MO) was given i.v. on days 0 and 2. Clinical symptoms

of EAE were evaluated using a 5 point scale as follows: 0 no clinical dis-
ease, 1.0 complete tail paralysis, 2.0 tail paralysis with hind limb weak-
ness, 3.0 hind limb paralysis, 4.0 hind limb paralysis and fore limb
weakness, 5.0 moribund/death. Vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline:
ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc Inc., Waltham, MA) or anti-muCD52 treatment
was given s.c. for ﬁve consecutive days as described in each individual ﬁg-
ure legend. A dose level of 10 mg/kg of anti-muCD52 was selected based
on its ability to achieve levels of lymphocyte depletion and kinetics of re-
population comparable to those observed with alemtuzumab administra-
tion in human CD52 transgenic mice (Hu et al., 2009; Turner et al., 2013)
and patients.

2.3. Flow cytometry analysis of immune cell populations and cytokine
expression

Quantitation of lymphocyte populations from the spleen and periph-
eral blood was performed by ﬂow cytometry analysis of single cell sus-
pensions as previously described (Turner et al., 2013). Isolation of
resident CNS (brain and spinal cord) lymphocytes was performed as de-
scribed (Rothhammer et al., 2011). Brieﬂy, CNS tissue from perfused an-
imals was digested with collagenase and DNAse followed by
mononuclear cell separation by Percoll density gradient centrifugation
(Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO). Mononuclear cells were collected and
used for ﬂow cytometry analysis. Staining of immune cells was per-
formed by incubating 1 × 106 cells with ﬂuorescently-labeled antibod-
ies against mouse cell surface markers including CD4 (RM4-5), CD8
(53–6.7) CD44 (1M7), CD62L (Mel-14), CD25 (PC61.5), FR4 (12A5),
B220 (RA3-6B2), NK1.1 (PK136), and, GR-1 (RB6.8C5) purchased from
Ebioscience (San Diego, CA) or BD Bioscience (San Jose, CA). Peripheral
blood was evaluated by staining 50 μl of whole blood with the indicated
antibodies followed by removal of contaminating red blood cells with
FACs lysis buffer (BD Bioscience) as described by the manufacturer. Fluo-
rescence intensities were determined using an LSR-II ﬂow cytometer (BD
Bioscience) and data analysis was performed using Flowjo software
(Treestar Inc., Ashland, OR).

Quantitation of absolute numbers of speciﬁc cell populations in the
spleen and CNS was determined by multiplying the percentage of the
FACS-identiﬁed cellular population by the total number of cells present
in each organ. Numbers of speciﬁc cell populations per microliter of pe-
ripheral blood were quantiﬁed using Countbright Absolute Counting
Beads (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) as described by
the manufacturer (number of cells/μl = number of cells counted / num-
ber of beads counted × number of beads added). Percent control for all
tissues was calculated by dividing the number of total cells for each pop-
ulation by the mean total number of the same cellular population from
the vehicle-treated control group [total cells in test animal/mean of total
cells in control group × 100].

Intracellular cytokine staining was performed by culturing
splenocytes in vitro with 1 μg/ml of MOG35–55 peptide for 5 h in the
presence of GolgiStop (BD Bioscience; San Jose, CA) as described by
the manufacturer. Cells were co-stained with anti-CD4, anti-IFNγ and
anti-IL-17 antibodies (Ebioscience, San Diego, CA).

Levels of cytokine release were evaluated by culturing splenocytes
in vitro for 48 h with 1 μg of MOG35–55 peptide or irrelevant peptide
(Ova323–339). Supernatants were then collected and analyzed for IL-1β,
IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, IFNγ and TNFα using an Aushon multi-
plex array (Aushon Biosystems, Billerica, MA) following the
manufacturer's instructions.

2.4. Immunohistochemistry

Spinal cord tissue samples were processed and sectioned by Mass His-
tology (Worcester, MA). Tissues were processed using a standard protocol
consisting of formalin ﬁxation and parafﬁn embedding, followed by cut-
ting of 5 μm thick sections. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was
performed on deparafﬁnized and rehydrated sections. Hematoxylin and

6

eosin-stained slides were used for pathological scoring of inﬂammatory
cell inﬁltrates as described below.

Staining for myelin basic protein (MBP) was performed on
deparafﬁnized and rehydrated slides, followed by endogenous per-
oxidase blocking using Peroxidazed-1 (Biocare Medical PX968M,
Concord, CA). Tissues were blocked with serum-free Protein Block
(Dako X0909, Carpinteria, CA) and primary rat anti-mouse MBP anti-
body (Abcam Ab7349, Cambridge, MA) or control rat IgG (Vector
Laboratories I-4000, Burlingame, CA) was added. Secondary rabbit
anti-rat IgG antibody (Vector Laboratories AI-4001) was incubated
at 1 μg/ml and signal ampliﬁcation was performed using Rabbit EnVi-
sion HRP polymer R.T.U. (Dako K4002, Carpinteria, CA). Binding was
detected using 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine (Dako K3467, Carpinteria,
CA) followed by counterstaining with Hematoxylin Gill's no. 1
(Sigma-Aldrich GHS1128, St. Louis, MO) and Tacha's Bluing Solution
(Biocare Medical HTBLU-MX, Concord, CA). The degree of demyelin-
ation was scored as described below.

Axonal damage was evaluated by staining for non-phosphorylated
neuroﬁlament heavy chain (SMI-32). Tissues were deparafﬁnized and
rehydrated followed by heat-induced antigen retrieval in Decloaking
Chamber™ NxGen (Biocare Medical DC2012, Concord, CA). After heat
treatment, endogenous peroxidase was blocked using Peroxidazed-1
(Biocare Medical PX968M, Concord, CA). Tissues were blocked with Ro-
dent Block M (Biocare Medical RBM961, Concord, CA) and incubated
with primary antibody consisting of mouse anti-non-phosphorylated
neuroﬁlaments (BioLegend SMI-32P, Dedham, MA) or control mouse
IgG1 (BD Pharmingen 557273, San Jose, CA) at 1 μg/ml. Secondary anti-
body containing anti-mouse IgG HRP R.T.U. (Biocare Medical MM510)
was added and detected using 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine followed by
counterstaining with Hematoxylin Gill's no. 1 and Tacha's Bluing Solu-
tion. SMI-32 stained slides were used for pathological scoring of axonal
damage.

Inﬂammation, myelin loss and axonal damage were all graded by a
pathologist blinded to treatment using a scale of 0–5 based on the ap-
proximate percentage of tissue involved with 0 = none, 1 = minimal
(less than 5.0%), 2 = mild (5–10%), 3 = moderate (10–25%), 4 = severe
(25–50%), and 5 = marked (N50%).

2.5. Electrophysiology

Spinal motor evoked potential (SMEP) recording was performed and
after the initiation of treatment with anti-muCD52 or vehicle. The mice
were deeply anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (50/2.86 mg/ml, i.p.)
and placed on a heat blanket to maintain body temperature at 34 °C. To
limit movement-related artifacts due to electrical stimulation-induced
muscle twitch, the animals' four limbs were restrained with tape.
Laminectomy was then performed to expose the C3 region of the spinal
cord for placement of the stimulating electrode (platinum microelec-
trode). A monopolar 27 gauge (g) needle reference electrode was
placed under the skin above the third digit of each foot and a monopolar
27 g needle electrode was inserted into the gastrocnemius muscle of the
corresponding hind limb for recording. Then, another monopolar 27 g
needle ground electrode was placed under the skin of the lower back.
To induce SMEPs, a 100 μs pulse of constant current was generated
by a Digitimer DS3 stimulus isolator and delivered to the spinal cord
C3 region every 30s through the stimulating electrode. The SMEP was
recorded from the gastrocnemius muscle of both hind limbs and ﬁltered
through a 300 Hz–1 kHz bandpass ﬁlter. The ﬁltered signal was then
encoded in the PowerLab data acquisition system and analyzed with
LabChart software.

The input–output functions were generated for each animal by vary-
ing the intensity of stimulus pulses (using the amplitude dial on the
stimulus isolator) in step increases (i.e. 0.5 mA, 1 mA, 1.5 mA, 2 mA,
2.5 mA, 3 mA, 3.5 mA, 4 mA). The responses were recorded for 1 min

at each stimulus intensity. The largest threshold SMEP evoked by the
lowest stimulus intensity was recorded for another 5 min for further
quantiﬁcation. The SMEP amplitude was measured between the ﬁrst
negative and the ﬁrst positive peaks, whereas the SMEP latency was
measured from the stimulus artifact to the ﬁrst negative peak of the
SMEP.

3. Results

3.1. Development and characterization of a novel anti-muCD52 antibody

To study the mechanism of action of anti-CD52 therapy in EAE
mouse models of MS, a murine IgG2a CD52-speciﬁc monoclonal anti-
body with depleting activity was generated. The speciﬁcity of the anti-
body was ﬁrst assessed by binding to CHO cells genetically engineered
to express murine CD52 (muCD52). As demonstrated in Fig. 1A, staining
with the anti-muCD52 antibody on the CHO-muCD52 cell line resulted
in increased mean ﬂuorescence intensity with little staining of the un-
modiﬁed parental CHO-K1 cells, indicating the speciﬁcity of the anti-
body for muCD52. Afﬁnity for CD52 was evaluated by surface plasmon
resonance (SPR) and found to be sub-nanomolar for CD52 peptide
(data not shown). We next evaluated the expression of muCD52 on
immune cell populations including T cells (CD4+, CD8+ and Treg), B
cells, natural killer (NK) cells and neutrophils (Fig. 1B). Murine CD52 ex-
pression was detected on 100% of the cells in each individual popula-
tion, with T cells demonstrating the highest levels of expression, B
cells expressing slightly lower levels of muCD52 and low levels of ex-
pression observed on NK cells. This expression pattern is similar to
that observed for human CD52 in patients and human CD52 transgenic
mice, with the exception of neutrophils which exhibited intermediate
levels of muCD52 compared to low or undetectable levels for human
CD52. (Elsner et al., 1996; Hu et al., 2009; Rao et al., 2012).

We next investigated the ability of the anti-muCD52 antibody to me-
diate lymphocyte depletion in vivo. Mice were injected i.v. with
10 mg/kg anti-muCD52, and three days later the numbers of lympho-
cytes in the spleen were quantiﬁed by ﬂow cytometry. As expected,
CD4 and CD8 T cells demonstrated the highest level of depletion (reduc-
tion of approximately 90%) followed by B cells and NK cells (reductions
of 69% and 35%, respectively) (Fig. 1C). The repopulation of these cell
types was also evaluated longitudinally in peripheral blood. In this
context, animals were treated with 5 daily doses of anti-muCD52
(10 mg/kg) to more closely resemble the dosing regimen used for
alemtuzumab in MS patients. All cell types demonstrated similar repop-
ulation kinetics with a return to baseline levels around day 100 post-
treatment with anti-muCD52 (Fig. 1D). This pattern is slightly different
from what is observed after alemtuzumab treatment in MS patients or
in alemtuzumab-treated human CD52 transgenic mice where B cell re-
population appears to occur more rapidly than T cell repopulation (Cox
et al., 2005; Hu et al., 2009). Overall, these data demonstrate that the
monoclonal antibody generated against muCD52 displays binding and
depleting characteristics similar to those exhibited by alemtuzumab
for human CD52.

3.2. Reduction of disease severity by anti-muCD52 treatment in EAE mouse
models

The ability of the anti-muCD52 antibody to mediate lymphocyte
depletion and the relatively long repopulation kinetics mimic treatment
with alemtuzumab and afforded the opportunity to evaluate the thera-
peutic activity of anti-muCD52 treatment in EAE mouse models of MS.
The anti-muCD52 antibody was ﬁrst tested in the commonly used
C57BL/6 EAE model in which disease is induced by immunization with
myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)35–55 peptide. Mice with
early disease symptoms (mean clinical score of ~1) were treated with
a 5-day course of 10 mg/kg anti-muCD52 or vehicle delivered s.c. on
days 12 through 16 after immunization. Reversal of disease symptoms

was observed as early as 2 days following the initiation of treatment
with anti-muCD52 and was maintained until the end of the study
(day 40) without any further treatment (Fig. 2A). In contrast, control
animals treated with vehicle continued to worsen, displaying an aver-
age disease score of ~2.5 by day 20 post-disease induction.

In addition to the MOG35–55-induced disease model, C57BL/6 mice
were also immunized with MOG1–121 peptide containing the

B) or SJL (C) mice were immunized with MOG35–55 (A), rMOG1–121 (B), or PLP139–151 pep-
tide (C) emulsiﬁed in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Animals were treated with either
vehicle (closed symbols) or anti-muCD52 (open symbols) from days 12–16 (denoted by
black bars on the X axis). Animals were scored for disease severity as described in Mate-
rials and methods. N = 10 animals/group. *p b 0.05.

extracellular domain of MOG (Fig. 2B). Disease in this model has been
reported to involve the contribution of both B and T lymphocytes com-
pared to MOG35–55 which primarily stimulates T cells (Huntington et al.,
2006). Animals with early disease symptoms were treated with a single
5-day course of anti-muCD52 or vehicle s.c. (days 12–16 post-EAE in-
duction) and, in this model as well, treatment with anti-muCD52 pro-
duced a reversal of symptoms and sustained inhibition of disease until
the end of the study (day 40). As expected, animals receiving the vehicle
developed signiﬁcant, persistent disability.

Treatment with anti-muCD52 also provided a similar beneﬁt in the
SJL model of relapsing remitting MS (Fig. 2C). In this model, SJL mice
were immunized with PLP139–153 and treated with a 5-day course of
anti-muCD52 on days 12–16 following disease induction. Treatment
with the antibody resulted in a reversal of disease symptoms and
prevention of relapse compared to vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 2C).
Overall, these results demonstrate the robust nature of anti-
muCD52 treatment in several models of EAE and parallel the long
term control of disease observed in the majority of RRMS patients
treated with alemtuzumab.

3.3. Impact of anti-muCD52 on pathogenic T cell responses in the spleen
and CNS

To gain insight into the immunological impact of anti-CD52 treat-
ment beyond what has been observed in the peripheral blood of MS pa-
tients, a longitudinal study was conducted in the MOG35–55 EAE model
to assess the numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the spleen and
CNS of diseased mice treated with anti-muCD52. As described above,
C57BL/6 mice were treated with a 5 day course of anti-muCD52 anti-
body or vehicle on days 12–16 post-immunization with MOG35–55
peptide. Cohorts of animals were sacriﬁced on days 5, 10, 20, 30, or 40
following disease induction. As expected, treatment with anti-
muCD52 resulted in a reduction in the numbers of CD4 and CD8 T
cells in the spleen (Fig. 3A, C). This reduction in cell numbers was ob-
served for the remainder of the study (Fig. 1D). CD4 and CD8 T cell num-
bers in the brain and spinal cord were also assessed by ﬂow cytometry
(Fig. 3B,D). An increase in the number of inﬁltrating CD4 and CD8 T
cells was observed in the CNS of vehicle-treated EAE mice between
days 10 and 20 post-disease induction. The kinetics of lymphocyte

muCD52 on days 12–16 (black bar on X axis). Cellular populations were evaluated by ﬂow cytometry at the indicated time points. CD4+ (A, B) and CD8+ (C, D) T cells were measured in the
spleen (A, C) or CNS (B, D). Numbers of MOG35–55 speciﬁc autoreactive T cells were quantiﬁed by ﬁrst stimulating splenocytes with MOG35–55 peptide for 4 h in vitro. CD4+ T cells express-
ing intracellular IFNγ (E) or IL-17 (F) were then enumerated by ﬂow cytometry. N = 5 animals/group. *p b 0.001, #p b 0.05.

inﬁltration correlate with the onset and progression of disease symp-
toms observed in this model (Fig. 2A). Inﬁltrating T cells were retained
in the CNS through day 40 likely contributing to the persistence of dis-
ease symptoms. In contrast, treatment with anti-muCD52 produced a
sustained reduction in the number of CD4 and CD8 T cells in the CNS
correlating with the inhibition of disease symptoms observed in treated
mice.

In addition to the assessment of total CD4+ T cells, the number of
disease-causing MOG35–55 reactive CD4 T cells in the spleens of treated
animals was evaluated by intracellular cytokine staining (Fig. 3E, F).
There was a signiﬁcant reduction in the number of CD4 T cells that pro-
duced either IFNγ or IL-17 in response to ex vivo stimulation with
MOG35–55 peptide in anti-muCD52-treated mice compared to control
mice. The difference was marked at day 20 when peak splenic reactivity
occurred and was followed by a return to similarly low levels of
cytokine-producing T cells at later time points in both groups (Fig. 3E,
F). We were unable to study MOG35–55-induced cytokine production
in CD4 T cells from the CNS as it was not possible to recover sufﬁcient
numbers of cells for this analysis.

Levels of in vitro cytokine secretion by unfractionated splenocytes
stimulated with MOG35–55 peptide were also measured (Fig. 4A, B).
Stimulation of day 20 splenocytes from vehicle-treated EAE mice result-
ed in the release of several cytokines, most prominently IFN-γ. There
was little or no cytokine release by splenocytes from anti-muCD52-
treated mice.

Taken together, these results indicate that administration of anti-
muCD52 not only reduces the number of circulating T lymphocytes
but also reduces the number of inﬁltrating T lymphocytes in the CNS
of EAE mice and decreases the number of MOG-reactive CD4 T cells
and overall cytokine production.

3.4. Reduction of CNS inﬂammation, demyelination and axonal damage by
anti-muCD52 therapy

As demonstrated above, the therapeutic beneﬁt provided by anti-
muCD52 treatment was associated with a reduction in pathogenic T
cell responses and we next sought to characterize the resulting impact
on CNS inﬂammation, demyelination and axonal damage. As in previous
studies, mice were treated with a 5-day course of anti-muCD52 or vehi-
cle on days 12–16 post-induction of disease with MOG35–55 peptide.
Five days later (day 21), cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions of the
spinal cord from each individual animal were collected and evaluated
histologically for levels of inﬂammation (H&E staining), degree of
myelination (anti-MBP staining) and axonal integrity (SMI-32 staining
of damaged non-phosphorylated neuroﬁlaments) as described in
Materials and methods (Fig. 5). In agreement with the ﬂow cytometry
results (Fig. 3), signiﬁcantly reduced immune cell inﬁltration was ob-
served in all regions of the spinal cord in anti-muCD52-treated mice
vs control mice (Fig. 5). This was accompanied by a signiﬁcant reduction
in the degree of spinal cord demyelination and axonal damage. Collec-
tively, these results demonstrate that treatment with anti-muCD52
strongly inhibited the development of CNS inﬂammation and concomi-
tant demyelination and axonal damage.

3.5. Reversal of established disease and preservation of axonal function by
anti-muCD52 treatment

Electrophysiology was used as a functional assessment of the beneﬁt
observed histologically in anti-muCD52-treated mice. In these studies,
treatment was delayed until the mice developed more advanced
disability and reached a disease score of 2 (Fig. 6A). Administration of
a 5 day course of anti-muCD52 at this stage of the disease still resulted
in a reversal of symptoms compared to vehicle-treated animals
(Fig. 6A). To assess the functional impact of anti-muCD52 treatment
on axonal conductance, the SMEP was evaluated in groups of mice
prior to the start of treatment (day 0) and on day 10 after the ﬁrst

dose. Fig. 6B shows the representative SMEP waveforms obtained on
day 10 after the initiation of treatment with vehicle or anti-muCD52 com-
pared to the waveform from normal mice evaluated in parallel. There was
a clear impairment of axonal conductance in vehicle-treated EAE mice
compared to normal mice with partial correction in anti-muCD52-
treated mice (Fig. 6B). Fig. 6C shows the stimulus–response curves of
the normal, vehicle-treated and anti-muCD52-treated mice. The curves
graphically display the SMEP size in response to stimuli of increasing in-
tensity. With gradual increases in stimulus intensity, increasing numbers
of axons are progressively activated. In the normal mice, a low stimulus
intensity (1 mA) was able to reach the maximal activation of the axons,
whereas a higher stimulus intensity (1.5 mA) was required to activate
all the axons in the vehicle-treated and anti-muCD52-treated groups.
However, the SMEP in anti-muCD52-treated mice was signiﬁcantly im-
proved in response to the same stimuli above the threshold intensity
when compared to the vehicle-treated group. Quantitative analysis
showed that a signiﬁcant reduction in SMEP peak amplitude in EAE
mice (18.86 ± 3.55 μV), compared to normal mice (33.14 ± 3.06 μV),
was already present before the start of treatment (day 0) and continued
to worsen in EAE mice treated with vehicle (day 10) (12.00 ± 2.85 μV).
In contrast, mice treated with anti-muCD52 did not experience further
deterioration and largely maintained the same peak amplitude out to
day 10 (22.75 ± 2.68 μV) (Fig. 6D). In this and another study, EAE mice
also displayed a small increase in peak latency prior to the start of

cells in EAE. C57BL/6 mice were immunized with MOG35–55 peptide emulsiﬁed in CFA
and treated with vehicle or anti-muCD52 from days 12–16. Cytokine expression was eval-
uated in vitro from day 20 splenocytes following stimulation with MOG35–55 peptide or
Ova323–339 control peptide. 48 h after stimulation, cytokine levels were determined by
Bioplex assay (N = 5 animals/group) (*p b 0.001, #p b 0.05).

treatment which remained present in vehicle-treated mice while peak la-
tency was closer to normal in anti-muCD52-treated mice (not shown).

Overall, the results show a functional beneﬁt in preservation of axo-
nal conductance in EAE mice treated with anti-muCD52 as evidenced by
electrophysiological assessment of SMEP peak amplitude and stimulus–
response curves.

4. Discussion

Studies of alemtuzumab's mechanism of action in RRMS patients
have by necessity been largely limited to the examination of blood lym-
phocyte populations and imaging of the CNS. EAE mouse models of
disease were used here to allow for a more extensive and direct assess-
ment of the effects of anti-CD52 treatment on pathogenic T cells and on
the CNS compartment in particular.

Due to the sequence disparity and lack of cross-reactivity between
human and mouse CD52, a novel monoclonal antibody speciﬁc for mu-
rine CD52 (anti-muCD52) was generated to investigate the effects of
anti-CD52 therapy in mouse EAE models. Analysis of antibody binding
by ﬂow cytometry and SPR conﬁrmed the speciﬁcity and high afﬁnity
of the antibody for murine CD52 (Fig. 1). The level of murine CD52 ex-
pression detected by the anti-muCD52 antibody showed a pattern sim-
ilar to that of CD52 on human immune cells, with the highest levels of
expression observed on T lymphocytes, slightly lower levels on B lym-
phocytes and little expression on NK cells. One difference was the
level of CD52 on mouse neutrophils, which was elevated compared to
what has been observed on human neutrophils that express little or
no CD52 (Fig. 1; Elsner et al., 1996). Nevertheless, treatment of mice
with anti-muCD52 resulted in immune cell depletion similar to what
has been observed in MS patients and in human CD52 transgenic mice
treated with alemtuzumab (Cox et al., 2005; Hu et al., 2009). There
was robust depletion of lymphocytes and the pattern of repopulation
also paralleled alemtuzumab observations although B and T lymphocytes
appeared to recover to baseline levels at the same rate in contrast to the

more rapid repopulation of B cells compared to T cells in alemtuzumab-
treated RRMS patients and human CD52 transgenic mice (Cox et al.,
2005; Hu et al., 2009). Overall, the ability of anti-muCD52 to replicate
the pattern of lymphocyte depletion followed by gradual repopulation
supported its use in EAE mouse models.

To better understand the mechanism of action of anti-CD52 treat-
ment, the therapeutic activity of the antibody was ﬁrst tested in three
different models of EAE reﬂecting different aspects of MS. EAE induced
by MOG35–55 peptide in C57BL/6 mice represents a standard acute
model of disease primarily driven by peptide-speciﬁc CD4+ cells while
EAE induced by MOG1–121 peptide is believed to involve the contribu-
tion of both T and B lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of the disease
(Huntington et al., 2006; Stromnes and Goverman, 2006; Molnarﬁ
et al., 2013). Finally, EAE induced by PLP139–151 peptide in SJL mice rep-
resents a standard model of relapsing–remitting disease involving T cell
reactivity and epitope spreading (McRae et al., 1995). Treatment with a
single course of anti-muCD52 in mice with early symptoms achieved
long term control of disease in all 3 models (Fig. 2) demonstrating efﬁ-
cacy against the different aspects of disease pathogenesis. Additional
studies in the MOG35–55 model also indicated that delayed administra-
tion of anti-muCD52 when the mice attained more signiﬁcant disability
with a disease score of 2 (full tail paralysis and hind limb paresis), was
still efﬁcacious and resulted in the reversal of disease symptoms
(Fig. 6). Importantly, long term monitoring of animals up to ~day 90
in this treatment paradigm, demonstrated that control of disease was
maintained without further retreatment in spite of complete lympho-
cyte repopulation in the blood and lymphoid organs (Supplemental
Fig. 1). These results are aligned with the hypothesis that initial deple-
tion of lymphocytes followed by rebalancing during repopulation is
part of the mechanism of action of anti-CD52 therapy.

The MOG35–55 model was used to directly test whether depletion of
pathogenic lymphocytes by anti-CD52 could in fact be linked to anti-
inﬂammatory effects in the CNS. As expected, treatment of diseased
mice with anti-muCD52 antibody reduced the numbers of splenic CD4

muCD52 from days 12–16 post-disease induction. Spinal cord tissue was collected 5 days following the ﬁnal dose of treatment (day 21) and stained with H&E for inﬂammation (top), anti-
MBP for degree of myelination (middle), or anti-non-phosphorylated neuroﬁlament for axonal damage (bottom). Pathology scores for cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions of the spinal
cord are presented on the right. N = 5 animals/group. *p b 0.001, #p b 0.05.

and CD8 T cells (Fig. 3). A signiﬁcant reduction in the number of T lym-
phocytes inﬁltrating the CNS was also observed in contrast to the
sustained elevation in the number of CD4 and CD8 T cells in the CNS
of vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 3). The observed reduction in the number
of CNS-inﬁltrating T cells is most likely due to peripheral, rather than
local, lymphocyte depletion given the generally poor CNS penetrance
of antibodies. Intracellular cytokine staining after ex vivo stimulation
with MOG35–55 peptide was used to more speciﬁcally assess the impact
of anti-muCD52 treatment on MOG-reactive, disease-causing CD4+ T
cells. The numbers of IFNγ and IL-17-producing CD4+ T cells were mea-
sured as these cytokines have been shown to play a role in promoting
disease in EAE as well as MS (Lock et al., 2002; Ishizu et al., 2005;
Durelli et al., 2009; Jager et al., 2009; Kebir et al., 2009). The results con-
ﬁrmed that treatment with anti-muCD52 did reduce the number of
these autoreactive, pathogenic T cells (Fig. 3E). In addition, evaluation
of inﬂammatory cytokine release by splenocytes stimulated with MOG
peptide showed an overall reduction in cytokine production in anti-
muCD52-treated mice (Fig. 4).

These results are in agreement with the contention that treatment of
RRMS patients with anti-CD52 can produce an anti-inﬂammatory effect
in the CNS through depletion of pathogenic lymphocytes and alterations
in the cytokine proﬁle. An overall decrease in CD4 and CD8 T cells has
also been observed in the peripheral blood of RRMS patients treated
with alemtuzumab although an assessment of the frequency of
autoreactive T cells has not yet been conducted. Similarly, a change in
the cytokine proﬁle of CD4+ T cells from alemtuzumab-treated patients
towards a less inﬂammatory phenotype has been reported and postulated
to play a role in the long term effect of the antibody (Zhang et al., 2013).

Evidence from clinical studies is suggestive of a neuroprotective/
neuroreparative beneﬁt in alemtuzumab-treated RRMS patients. An im-
provement in disability has been observed using different clinical as-
sessments including EDSS, MSFC, and MSFC plus Sloan scores (Coles
et al., 2012a,b; Hartung et al., 2012; Graves et al., 2014). This improve-
ment was maintained in the absence of ongoing treatment in most pa-
tients (Fox et al., 2013) and was independent of the history of relapses
i.e. not solely due to a direct anti-inﬂammatory effect (Fernández
et al., 2013). In addition, continued slowing in the rate of brain atrophy
was also observed without re-treatment in the majority of patients over
a 3 year period (Arnold et al., 2014). The MOG35–55 EAE model provided
the opportunity to directly examine the CNS compartment to explore
this aspect. First, the impact of anti-muCD52 treatment on the CNS
was evaluated histologically. The spinal cord is more severely affected
than the brain in this model and comprehensive examination of the cer-
vical, thoracic and lumbar areas showed that treatment with anti-
muCD52 reduced the presence of inﬂammatory cell inﬁltrates (in agree-
ment with the ﬂow cytometry data) and dramatically reduced the level
of demyelination and axonal damage (Fig. 5). This improvement was
observed 5 days after the ﬁnal dose of treatment (Fig. 5) as well as up
to 24 days post-treatment (not shown). These observations are in
agreement with an immediate beneﬁt of lymphocyte depletion follow-
ed by an environment that favors maintenance of CNS integrity.

In follow-up studies, electrophysiology was used as a functional as-
sessment of the impact of anti-muCD52 treatment on axonal conduc-
tance. Importantly, in these studies, treatment was delayed until the
mice reached a disease score of 2 and exhibited abnormal SMEP with
decreased peak amplitude, slightly higher threshold stimulus for

activation and a trend for increased peak latency. Reduced amplitude
can largely be attributed to a decrease in the number and integrity of
nerve ﬁbers while increased latency typically results from inefﬁcient
conductance in demyelinated ﬁbers. The results indicated that, while
the peak amplitude of the SMEP continued to deteriorate in vehicle-
treated mice, the SMEP amplitude was maintained in anti-muCD52-
treated mice (Fig. 6D). These results are in line with the histological
ﬁndings showing a reduction in damaged axons (Fig. 5). There was
also an apparent increase in latency in EAE mice compared to normal
mice although the difference did not reach statistical signiﬁcance in all
studies. Anti-muCD52-treated mice showed a peak latency closer to
normal compared to vehicle-treated mice, in agreement with the re-
duced demyelination observed histologically. However, given the
small differences in latency, it is difﬁcult to reach a ﬁrm conclusion re-
garding this parameter. Overall, these ﬁndings suggest that anti-
muCD52 treatment in mice with active disease protects the CNS against
further damage and perhaps enables endogenous repair mechanisms
resulting in long term reversal of disease symptoms and maintenance
of axonal conductance.

Although the mechanism of action of alemtuzumab is not fully under-
stood, the results from clinical and animal studies to date support the pre-
mise that the therapeutic beneﬁt of the antibody involves the depletion of
lymphocytes, including auto-reactive T cells, followed by rebalancing of
the immune system during lymphocyte repopulation resulting in de-
creased CNS inﬂammation and protection of CNS integrity.
