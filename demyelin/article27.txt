Abstract
Background: Progesterone as a sex steroid hormone is thought 
to affect and prevent demyelination, but its role in promoting 
myelin repair is far less investigated. In this study, remyelinating 
potential of progesterone in corpus callosum was evaluated on 
an experimental model of MS. 
Methods: In this experimental study, adult male C57BL/6 mice 
were fed with 0.2% (w/w) cuprizone in ground breeder chow ad 
libitum for 6 weeks. At day zero, after cuprizone removal, mice 
were  divided  randomly  into  two  groups:  (a)  placebo  group, 
which  received  saline  pellet  implant,  (b)  progesterone  group, 
which received progesterone pellet implant. Some mice of the 
same age were fed with their normal diet to serve as the healthy 
control  group.  Two  weeks  after  progesterone  administration, 
Myelin content was assessed by Luxol-fast blue staining. The 
myelin  basic  protein  (MBP)  and  proteolipid  protein  (PLP) 
expression were assessed using Western blot analysis and the 
changes in the number of oligodendrocytes and oligodendroglial 
progenitor cells were assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
and flow cytometry.
Results:  Luxol-fast  blue 
enhanced 
remyelination in the progesterone group when compared with 
the placebo group. Densitometry measurements of immunoblots 
demonstrated  that  MBP  and  PLP  proteins  contents  were 
significantly  increased  in  the  progesterone  group  compared 
with  the  placebo  group.  Flow  cytometry  and  IHC  analysis 
showed  increases  in  Olig2  and  O4 cells  in  the  progesterone 
group compared with the placebo group.
Conclusion:  Overall,  our  results  indicate  that  progesterone 
treatment  can  stimulate  myelin  production  and  that  it  may 
provide  a  feasible  and  practical  way  for  remyelination  in 
diseases such as multiple sclerosis.

Introduction

Multiple sclerosis, a chronic and debilitating inflammatory disease 
of  the  CNS  is  characterized  by  myelin  damage.1  In  multiple 
sclerosis,  although  resident  oligodendrocyte  progenitors  are 
found  around  the  lesions,  they  remain  in  a  quiescent  state  and 
remyelination  is  incomplete.2  Thus,  therapeutic  strategies  that

promote remyelination are likely to have significant 
beneficial effects. One approach is to enhance or 
re-activate  the  endogenous  process.3  The  idea 
that sex steroids are involved in MS and that they 
might be a therapeutic option also originates from 
retrospective  studies  revealing  that  pregnancy 
has  a  favorable  trend  for  the  course  of  MS  on 
a  short- and  long-term  basis.4  Remission  of 
symptoms is seen during pregnancy, in particular 
during  the  last  trimester  when  estrogens  and 
progesterone plasma levels are at their maximum.5 
Postpartum,  MS  symptoms  exacerbate  again.4 
Recent  reports,  however,  have  shown 
that 
progesterone  decreases  neuropathology  when 
given at the time of demyelination induction,1,3,6 but 
its therapeutic role in promoting myelin repair after 
induced demyelination is far less investigated.7-10 
This  is  due  to  the  conflicting  results  obtained  in 
the  experimental  autoimmune  encephalomyelitis 
(EAE)  model,  which  indicated  negative  as  well 
as  positive  effects  for  progesterone  on  disease 
progression.7,8

In vivo studies on animal models of MS have 
drawn  the  attention  on  immune  modulatory 
functions  of  sex  steroids  and  thus  EAE  model 
has been used.1,7,8

To  be  able 

to  distinguish  between 

the 
immunomodulating  effects  of  progesterone 
and  direct  effects  on  repair  capacity  of  the 
brain,  we  used  the  potential  of  non-immune 
driven  cuprizone 
intoxication.  Demyelination 
in  the  cuprizone  model  is  an  early  observable 
event  without  damaging  other  CNS  cell 
types;  besides  oligodendrocytes  and  without 
provoking  the  breakdown  of  the  blood  brain 
barrier  and  subsequently  causing  the  invasion 
of  lymphocytes.1  In  addition,  the  cuprizone 
model  shares  common 
the 
earliest  phases  of  MS  lesion  development  as 
described by Barnett and Prineas.11 In this study, 
remyelinating potential of progesterone in corpus 
callosum was evaluated after cuprizone-induced 
demyelination as an experimental model of MS.

Materials and Methods

Induction of Demyelination and Hormone 
Administration

A  total  of  20 male  C57BL/6  mice  (Pasteur 
Institute  of  Iran)  were  fed  with  0.2%  (w/w) 
cuprizone (Sigma, USA) in ground breeder chow 
ad libitum for 6 weeks. This diet leads to selective 
oligodendrocyte death followed by demyelination 
of  axons  mainly  in  the  corpus  callosum.12  On 
day zero after cuprizone removal, animals were 
randomly  divided  into  two  groups:  (a)  placebo 
group,  which  received  saline  pellet  implant 
(n=10), (b) progesterone group, which received 

progesterone pellet implant (n=10). Some mice 
of the same age were fed with their normal diet to 
serve as healthy control group (n=10). On day zero 
after  cuprizone  removal,  progesterone  treated 
mice were implanted with 14-day release pellets 
containing  200 mg  progesterone  (Innovative 
Research  of  America,  Sarasota,  USA).  Pellets 
were implanted subcutaneously in the scapular 
region  behind  the  neck  with  a  12-gauge  trocar 
as described by the manufacturer. Placebo mice 
were  implanted  with  saline  pellets  (Innovative 
Research  of  America,  Sarasota,  USA).  Mice 
were sacrificed at the end of the second week. 
The  animal  experiments  were  approved  by  the 
Ethics Committee of Tehran University of Medical 
Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

Tissue Preparation

For  histological  and  immunohistochemical 
studies, mice were intracardially perfused with 4% 
paraformaldehyde (Merck, Germany) containing 
picric  acid.  After  overnight  postfixation,  brains 
were  dissected  and  processed  routinely  for 
paraffin  (Merck,  Germany)  embedding.  Then, 
10  μm  serial,  sagital  sections  were  prepared 
from  corpus  callosum.  Among  these  serial 
sections,  four  representative  sections  at  least 
240 μm apart from each other were subject to 
immunostaining with anti olig2 antibody.

Myelin Staining

To  stain  for  myelin  content,  tissue  sections 
from mice were treated with Luxol fast blue (LFB, 
Sigma,  USA).  Sections  were  stained  overnight 
in LFP at 56°C and washed in 95% ethanol and 
distilled water to remove excess blue stain. The 
color was then differentiated (until white matter 
was easily distinguishable from gray matter) in 
lithium  carbonate  solution  (Merck,  Germany) 
for 15 sec, followed by distilled water and three 
washes  of  80%  alcohol.  Slides  were  passed 
through  fresh  xylene  (Merck,  Germany)  twice, 
mounted  with  Entellan  (Merck,  Germany)  and 
cover slipped.3 In order to evaluate remyelination 
in  LFB 
cuprizone 
demyelination  of  the  corpus  callosum  in  the 
mice that received progesterone, three blinded 
readers  scored  LFB  stained  sections  between 
zero  and  three.  A score  of  three  is  equivalent 
to  totally  myelinated  corpus  callosum  whereas 
zero is equivalent to totally demyelinated corpus 
callosum. A score of one or two corresponds to 
one-third  or  two-third  fiber  myelination  of  the 
corpus callosum, respectively.1

at -20°C.  To  ensure  loading  of  equal  amounts 
during  Western  blotting,  protein  concentration 
of  each  sample  was  determined  with  Bradford 
assay. Equivalent amounts of total protein extract 
from each sample were mixed with sample buffer, 
boiled, and loaded onto SDS polyacrylamide gels. 
Electrophoretic  separation  of  the  extracts  was 
typically performed on 7.5–15% gel. The proteins 
were  then  transferred  to  polyvinylidene  (PVDF) 
(Gibco,  CA)  and  probed  with  MBP  antibody 
(1:3000 
(Abcam,  USA) 
and  PLP  antibody  (1:1000  in  blocking  buffer) 
(Abcam, USA) for an overnight on shaker in 4°C. 
Membranes were subsequently rinsed in blocking 
buffer (4 times/3 min each time) and stained with 
secondary  antibody  (1:1000  in  blocking  buffer) 
(Abcam,  USA)  for  1  hour.  Then,  membranes 
were washed with TBS Tween-20 blocking buffer 
(3 times)  and  the  proteins  were  visualized  with 
diaminobenzidine  (DAB)  kit  (Sigma,  USA).  The 
membranes were scanned and the photos were 
analyzed with image 2 software.

were incubated overnight with rabbit anti-Olig2 
polyclonal  antibody  (1:2000;  Millipore,  CA, 
USA).  The  next  day,  sections  were  incubated 
with  biotinylated  secondary  antibody  (Sigma, 
USA).  This  was  followed  by  1  h  incubation  at 
RT  with  avidin-biotin-peroxidise  complex.  For 
visualization,  the  DAB  was  used.  Finally,  the 
sections were dehydrated in a graded series of 
ethanol, cleared in xylene, and coverslipped with 
Entellan (Merck, Germany) and examined with a 
Nikon Eclipse 55i (Nikon, Germany) microscope. 
Quantification  of  cell  numbers  was  performed 
by  manual  counting  the  number  of  positive

mouse antibody IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate 
(FITC) (1:100, Invitrogen, CA, USA) was used. 
Samples  were  analyzed  with  a  FACSCalibur

Statistics Analysis

Statistical analysis was performed by one-way 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s 
post-hoc  test.  Data  is  reported  as  mean±SEM. 
P<0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results

Light Microscope Examination 

Histological  examination  of  tissue  sections 
was  performed  two  weeks  after  treatment. 
Luxol  fast  blue  histologic  stain  was  used  to 
assess  the  extent  of  remyelination  in  corpus 
callosum  after  implantation  of  progesterone 
pellet. High intensity staining was evident in the 
healthy  control  group  (Figure 1A).  Two  weeks 
after  progesterone  implantation,  an  obvious 
remyelination was seen (Figure 1C), while less 
remyelination  was  seen  in  the  placebo  group 
(Figure 1B).

Quantification of myelin content in the body 
of  corpus  callosum  (Figure 1D)  shows  that  in 
progesterone pellet implanted mice there was a 
further significant increase in the remyelination 
score (1.65±0.1; P≤0.05), compared with saline 
pellet  implanted  (placebo)  mice  (0.25±0.05; 
P≤0.05).

Western Blot Assay

Densitometric measurements of immunoblots 
demonstrated that MBP and PLP contents were 
significantly lower in all treated groups compared 
with the healthy control group (Figure 2A). In the 
progesterone pellet implantation group, after two 
weeks  of  hormone  administration,  there  were 
significant  increase  in  MBP  (0.72±0.1;  P≤0.05) 
contents  compared  with  the  placebo  group 
(0.24±0.1;  P≤0.05)  but  less  than  the  healthy 
control  group  (0.95±0.06;  P≤0.05)  (Figure  2B). 
The PLP contents were significantly increased in 
progesterone receiving group (0.8±0.09; P≤0.05) 
compared  with  the  placebo  group  (0.1±0.03; 
P≤0.05) but less than t  he healthy control group 
(0.99±0.08; P≤0.05).

olig2 and O4 expression was quantified by flow 
cytometry (Figure 4A). According to Figure 4C, 
the  mean  percentages  of  expression  of  olig2 
decreased  in  the  placebo  group  (4.27±1.2; 
P≤0.05) when compared with the control health 
group  (5.54±0.64;  P≤0.05)  without  reaching 
statistical significant values. Such decrease was 
significantly  reversed  in  animals  that  received 
progesterone (40.06±1.4; P≤0.05).

the  mean  percentages  of 
expression  of  O4,  an  oligodendrocyte  marker, 
was significantly increased in the progesterone 
group  (24.4±0.6;  P≤0.05)  compared  with  the 
placebo group (1.52±0.2; P≤0.05), but less than 
the  healthy  control  group  (54.2±0.8;  P≤0.05) 
(Figure 4B).

Discussion

Patients  suffering  from  MS  experience  a 
significant decline in the rate of relapse during 
the third trimester of pregnancy and a significant 
increase during the first 3 months post-partum.13 
Thus,  relapse  decrease  when  levels  of  many 
hormones are elevated, and in particular those 
of  progesterone,  and  increase  when  hormone 
levels decline to pre-pregnancy levels following 
delivery.14

Our  study  attempted  to  investigate  the  role 
of  progesterone  after  experimentally  induced 
demyelination  in  the  male  corpus  callosum 
using  cuprizone  as  toxic  agent.  To  induce  the 
demyelination,  cuprizone  model  was  used 
due  to  its  reproducibility,  simplicity,  and  low 
mortality.15 Cuprizone feeding for several weeks

demyelinating insult with cuprizone. A numerous 
experimental  studies,  have  demonstrated 
the  multiple  actions  of  progesterone  and  its 
metabolites throughout the nervous system and 
their  considerable  influence  on  the  functioning 
of the glial cells.18 The influence of progesterone 
administration on the course of demyelination in 
experimental models for MS is well documented. 
For 
that 
administration  of  progesterone  could  attenuate 
demyelination  in  the  lysolecithin-injured  spinal 
cord.3,10,19  Others  have  shown  the  application 
of  progesterone  possesses  the  capacity  of 
inhibiting  mature  oligodendrocyte  damage  and 
reduced  demyelination  in  cuprizone  provoked 
demyelination of corpus callosum.1,6 A particular 
asset  of  progesterone  is  that  it  not  only  could 
attenuate  demyelination,  but  also  promotes 
myelin  formation  either  during  development  or 
during the remyelination of axons in the adult.18
Labombarda  et  al.  demonstrated  that  short 
PROG treatment increased the number of OPC, 
increased the expression of MBP, and enhanced 
the  expression  of 
the  Olig2  and  Nkx2.2 
transcription factors involved in specification and 
differentiation  of  the  oligodendrocyte  lineage.19 
In another study, mice were induced with EAE 
and treated with progesterone had a decreased 
clinical  severity  and  enhanced  expression  of 
transcription factors essential for oligodendrocyte 
and  myelin  protein  transcripts.20  Hussain  et  al. 
showed  that  progesterone  strongly  increased 
the reappearance of cells of the oligodendroglial 
lineage in the demyelinated area.9

Although the cellular mechanisms responsible 
for  the  therapeutic  effects  of  progesterone  on 
remyelination  remain  unclear,  however 
two 
hypotheses need to be considered. Progesterone 
as  a  neurosteroid  hormone  may  participate  to 
remyelination by either stimulating the proliferation 
and maturation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells 
into  mature  oligodendrocytes  able  to  form  new 
myelin1,3,6 or indirectly by modulating autoimmune 
and 
in 
cuprizone-induced  demyelination,  an  invasion 
of T  or  B  cells  is  not  observed.1 Therefore,  our 
study clearly shows that progesterone treatment 
is able to enhance remyelination of injured corpus 
callosum  also  independent  of  a  B  and  T  cell 
initiated autoimmune reaction.

inflammatory  processes.21  However,

In this study, results of immunohistochemistry 
and 
that 
progesterone treatment after cuprizone induced 
demyelination significantly increased the number 
of  olig2+  cells  (an  oligodendroglial  progenitor 
cell marker) and O4+ cells (an oligodendrocyte 
marker) in corpus callosum of mice. In addition, 
Western blot analysis shows that progesterone 

the 

increased expression of MBP and PLP proteins. 
The  remyelination  of  corpus  callosum  involves 
initially 
recruitment  of  oligodendrocyte 
progenitors  from  the  surrounding  intact  white 
matter into the area of demyelination and their 
subsequent  differentiation 
into  remyelinating 
oligodendrocytes.3  The  improvements  of  the 
remyelination rate that we find in progesterone 
treated animals may result from an enhancement in 
either or both of the recruitment and differentiation 
phases of remyelination. However, the signaling 
mechanisms involved in the myelinating actions 
of progesterone are not well defined. This is an 
important  question  since  progesterone  acts  on 
multiple  targets  within  the  nervous  system.18 
Although the molecular mechanisms employed 
by progesterone to improve remyelination after 
cuprizone demyelination induction were beyond 
the scope of our current study, some possibilities 
are  worth  mentioning.  It  has  been  shown  that 
oligodendrocytes  generation  is  a  multiple-step 
process  in  which  oligodendroglial  progenitor 
cells  proliferate,  migrate,  and  differentiate  into 
mature  oligodendrocytes.22 
In  a  chemically 
induced multiple sclerosis model, remyelination 
is due to differentiation and maturation of adult 
oligodendroglial progenitor cells instead of pre-
existing  oligodendrocytes  that  suffer  apoptotic 
cell death.19 A stimulatory effect of progesterone 
on  myelination  was  observed  in  cerebellar 
slices.18 Progesterone was shown to stimulate the 
proliferation  and  maturation  of  oligodendrocyte 
progenitor  cells  in  these  slices.  Recently,  it 
was  reported  that  progesterone  increased  the 
number  of  new  oligodendrocytes1,3,6  and  this 
results supports the idea that the progesterone 
imposes  a  milieu  favoring  differentiation  of 
proliferating progenitors into mature forms.19

Conclusion

The  results  obtained  in  the  present  study 
indicate  that  progesterone  therapy  enhanced 
remyelination of demyelinated corpus callosum 
axons in cuprizone model of MS.
