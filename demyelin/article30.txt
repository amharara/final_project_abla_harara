A culture system that can recapitulate myelination in vitro will not only help us better understand 
the mechanism of myelination and demyelination, but also find out possible therapeutic 
interventions for treating demyelinating diseases. Here, we introduce a simple and reproducible 
myelination culture system using mouse motor neurons (MNs) and Schwann cells (SCs). Dissociated 
motor neurons are plated on a feeder layer of SCs, which interact with and wrap around the axons 
of MNs as they differentiate in culture. In our MN-SC coculture system, MNs survived over 3 weeks 
and extended long axons. Both viability and axon growth of MNs in the coculture were markedly 
enhanced as compared to those of MN monoculture. Co-labeling of myelin basic proteins (MBPs) and 
neuronal microtubules revealed that SC formed myelin sheaths by wrapping around the axons of 
MNs. Furthermore, using the coculture system we found that treatment of an antioxidant substance 
coenzyme Q10 (Co-Q10) markedly facilitated myelination.

Myelin provides an electrically insulating material that forms a multilayered sheath around an axon of 
a neuron. In the peripheral nervous system (PNS), myelin sheath is generated by Schwann cells (SCs), 
whereas in the central nervous system (CNS), myelin is produced by oligodendrocytes. The myelin wrap-
ping of axons by SCs and oligodendrocytes not only facilitates the conduction of action potentials in the 
nervous system, but also protects axons and provides nutritional support to associated axons. As various 
defects in myelination, such as hypomyelination, delayed myelination, or demyelination, are known to 
cause serious disorders in the nervous system1–4, understanding how SCs and oligodendrocytes initially 
produce myelin during development and remyelinate axons in the diseased nervous system is of signif-
icant clinical interest. In many cases of nerve repair after physical injury, an incomplete myelination of 
regenerated nerve fibers causes malfunction of repaired nerve5.

To understand the process of myelination and remyelination, several in vitro models have been devel-
oped.  Methods  to  culture  SCs  and  oligodendrocytes  have  been  established  and  extensively  applied  to 
investigate  the  biology  of  myelinating  glia6–8,  and  these  cultures  greatly  improved  the  understanding 
of how SCs and oligodendrocytes differentiate and mature. In addition to culture systems comprising 
pure SCs or oligodendrocytes, coculture systems composed of both neurons and myelinating glia should 
provide insights into the interaction between myelination glial cells and axons as well as the myelinating 
process. To this end, previous studies described coculture systems of oligodendrocytes and hippocampal 
neurons8,  SCs  and  sensory  neurons  (from  dorsal  root  ganglia)6,  or  oligodendrocytes  and  retinal  gan-
glion cells9. Recently, Gingras et al.10 reported a method for culturing primary motor neurons (MNs) on 
collagen-chitosan sponges seeded with fibroblasts or with fibroblasts and Schwann cells, which enabled 
long-term  culture  (lasting  more  than  a  month)  of  MNs.  However,  the  protocol  required  21  days  of

Figure 2.  Flowchart of the differentiation of MNs in culture. Examples of light microscopic images of MN 
monoculture and MN-SC coculture at different stages are shown. In the MN monoculture, purified neurons 
form synapses at DIV 7, but viability greatly reduces by DIV 14. In the MN-SCs coculture, SCs are cultured for 
7 days, and then MNs are grown on top of the SC feeder layer. MNs in the coculture survive for at least  
3 weeks and motor axon diameter increases (arrows, yellow). All images are at the same scale. Scale bar, 50 µm.

culture before the addition of MNs, and efficient axon outgrowth could be achieved by the addition of 
high concentrations of several exogenous neurotrophic supplements, including BDNF, neurotrophin-3, 
glial-derived neurotrophic factor, and ciliary neurotrophic factor. On the other hand, Haastert et al.11 
reported that when cultured on a feeder layer of SCs, MNs without supplementary support of neuro-
trophic  factors  matured  in  culture  for  20  days  in  vitro  (DIV),  but  that  the  fraction  of  MNs  gradually 
reduced from higher than 70% on DIV 3 down to 12% by DIV 20. In addition, in the coculture model 
of  MNs  and  SCs,  MNs  matured  with  enlarged  somata  but  myelination  of  MN  axons  by  SCs  was  not 
achieved during the culture period.

In  the  present  study,  we  report  a  coculture  system  comprising  primary  mouse  MNs  and  SCs.  In 
our system, MNs survived for at least 3 weeks in culture and more importantly, SCs differentiated and 
formed myelin sheath around the axons of MNs. In the coculture, neurons exhibited higher viability and 
extended longer axons as compared to MN monoculture. By employing standard cell biological and bio-
chemical approaches, we have confirmed that SCs myelinate MN axons within 3 weeks of coculture. The 
formation of myelin sheath was confirmed at the ultrastructural level. Furthermore, using the MN-SC 
coculture, we show that treatment with coenzyme Q10 facilitates myelination.

assessed by double-staining with calcein-AM and propidium iodide (PI) at DIV 0, 7, 14, or 21, as indicated 
(A and C). Samples were then fixed and immunostained with DAPI and NeuN antibodies (B and D).

3 mm-thick matrigel. SCs were cultured for a week until cells formed a confluent feeder layer. On top of 
SC feeder layer, purified MNs obtained from the ventral horns of gestation day 14 embryos (E14) were 
seeded and cocultured (Fig. 1B, MN-SC coculture). As a control, MNs were cultured directly on matrigel 
without prior culture of SCs (Fig. 1A, MN monoculture). In the MN monoculture, MNs extended axons 
up to DIV 7, but neurons gradually degenerated thereafter and by DIV 14, few MNs survived (Fig. 2). By 
contrast, in the MN-SC coculture, neurons differentiated and developed neurites and remained intact up 
to at least DIV 21. On DIV 3, we were able to detect migration of SCs toward the axons of MNs and on 
DIV 7, we observed nuclei of SCs around the axons. We also compared cell viability in MN monoculture 
and MN-SC coculture systems by using Live-Dead cell staining kit and NeuN-DAPI double antibody 
staining methods (Details in Methods section). In the MN monoculture, vast majority of neurons (96%) 
failed to survive (Fig. 3A,B). The MN-SC coculture, however, showed almost no cell death up to DIV 21 
(Fig. 3C). Furthermore, the viable MN cell number was maintained throughout the culture, whereas the 
viable SC cell number steadily increased up to DIV 21 (Fig. 3D), suggesting that SCs play a critical role 
in supporting the survival of MNs.

We next quantitatively examined the effects of SCs on axon outgrowth of MNs using TuJ1 staining 
for the nerve fibers and ImageJ to quantify the fiber length (Fig. 4). When axon length was measured at 
2 days after plating MNs (Fig. 4A), average axon length of MNs grown in the MN-SC coculture system 
was about 4 times longer than that of MN monoculture. In the MN-SC coculture, axons grew at a rate 
of about 50 µ m per day, which is consistent with a previous report7. Taken together, these results suggest 
that SCs are essential for the survival and neurite outgrowth of MNs.

Myelination of Motor Neurons.  To investigate if SCs differentiate and more importantly myelinate 
MN  axons  in  our  MN-SC  coculture  system,  cultures  were  examined  for  expression  of  markers  of  SC 
differentiation and myelination, such as myelin basic protein (MBP), SRY-related HMGbox-10 (Sox10) 
and Krox20. We found that the expression of Sox10, a transcription factor which controls myelination 
in the PNS12, was detected in the soma of SCs on DIV 7 and increased thereafter (Fig. 5). Expression of 
MBP was detected on DIV 10, and eventually became highly localized along the axon fiber by DIV 14 
(Fig. 5, green). Western blot analysis confirmed the expression of MBP and Krox20, a transcription factor 
induced by the activation of Sox10. Krox20 is known to suppress the immature state and promote myeli-
nation13,14. We observed an increase of both MBP and Krox20 protein levels over time (Fig. 6), consistent 
with  our  immunocytochemistry  results  (Fig.  5).  Next,  we  examined  myelin  sheath  formation  on  DIV 
21  in  detail  by  confocal  microscopy  and  transmission  electron  microscopy  (TEM).  Z-stack  images  of 
confocal microscopy confirmed tight interaction between MBP and axons of MNs (Fig. 7, Supplemental 
movie 1). By taking TEM images, we confirmed that SCs formed loose sheaths by DIV 14, which could 
be the premyelination stage (Fig. 8A,B), and that SCs tightly wrapped the nerve fiber by DIV21, which 
could  be  the  completed  myelination  stage  (Fig.  8C,D).  The  thickness  of  compact  myelin  sheaths  was 
approximately 0.2 µ m at DIV 21.

It  is  well-known 
Distinct Stages  of  Myelination Observed  in  the  MN-SC Coculture System. 
that oligodendrocytes in the CNS differentiate from pre-myelinating to myelinating stage and the transi-
tion is controlled by several intrinsic and extrinsic signals15. Likewise, in our MN-SC coculture system, 
SC  myelination  proceeded  through  two  distinct  stages,  which  could  be  distinguished  on  the  basis  of 
MBP  expression  pattern  and  interaction  with  axons  as  mentioned  above  in  the  TEM  images.  In  the 
pre-myelinating stage, expression of MBP in SCs was relatively widespread, whereas in the myelinating 
stage, MBP expression in SCs was tightly localized along the axons. By counting the number of these two 
different types of SCs under confocal microscope, we found that while most SCs were at pre-myelinating 
stage  when  observed  on  DIV  10,  the  number  of  myelinating  SCs  gradually  increased  in  culture  and 
reached 80% by DIV 21 (Fig. 9B).

Promotion  of  MN  myelination  by  Coenzyme  Q10.  We  next  treated  our  coculture  samples 
with  drugs  implicated  in  the  treatment  of  neurological  diseases.  Samples  were  treated  with  riluzole 
(2-amino-6-(trifluoromethoxy) benzothiazole), an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS)16, a debilitating neuromuscular disease which involves the death of motor neurons, 
or  with  coenzyme  Q10  (Co-Q10)  (1,4-benzoquinone,  also  known  as  ubiquione),  an  antioxidant  and 
mitochondrial  cofactor,  which  has  been  considered  as  a  potential  therapeutic  agent  for  demyelinating 
and neurodegenerative diseases17,18. As shown in Fig. 10A,B, Co-Q10 treatment facilitated MBP expres-
sion and increased the number of myelin-forming SCs as compared to control. When observed on DIV 
7, MBP expression was detected only in Co-Q10-treated cultures but not in control or riluzole-treated 
cultures. By DIV 14, MBP expression was also detected in control and riluzole-treated cultures, but the 
percentage of myelinating SCs was lower as compared to Co-Q10-treated cultures. By DIV 21, all cul-
tures expressed MBP. In all cultures, we detected an increase of Krox20 expression, demonstrating that 
SCs differentiate properly in our MN-SC coculture system and that treatment of riluzole or Co-Q10 did

not affect the transition from pre-myelinating to myelinating stage per se but perhaps control later stages 
of SC myelination (Fig. 10C).

Discussion
Several in vitro models have been previously developed to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms 
involved in the myelination process. Sensory neurons from dorsal root ganglia6,7,19,20 or retinal ganglia21 
were cocultured with SCs to induce the formation of myelin sheath in vitro. Several in vitro models for 
MN culture have also been introduced10,11,22–24, and the findings from these studies have confirmed that 
addition of exogenous neurotrophic supplements and/or a coculture with SCs or fibroblasts was critical

for  the  survival  and  neurite  outgrowth  of  MNs  cultured  in  vitro.  MN  cultures  treated  with  astrocyte 
conditioned medium23 or insulin-like growth factor-122 could specifically enhance the extent and rate of 
axonal outgrowth from murine corticospinal MNs. However, to the best of our knowledge, no culture 
method  to  date  has  recapitulated  the  myelination  process  of  MN  by  SCs  in  vitro.  Moreover,  previous 
studies have attempted to culture MNs by using NycoPrepTM, OptiPrepTM, or immunopanning dishes, 
but the purified MNs frequently failed to survive long-term11,24,25. In this study, we have aimed at con-
structing a MN-SC coculture system to model both the axon outgrowth and the myelination process of 
MN.

Here  we  have  confirmed  that  SCs  play  an  essential  role  in  increasing  the  viability  and  promoting 
axonal outgrowth of MNs. Consistent with our results, several groups have reported that SCs enhance

Figure 9.  Pre-myelinating and myelinating SCs. (A) The process of myelination. SCs envelop an axon and 
continue to produce myelin. SCs then wrap their plasma membrane loosely around an axon, yielding in 
multiple successive layers. Membrane wrappings are compacted into a tightly packed insulation coat. (B) SCs

long-term viability of peripheral neurons and protect the axonal integrity. Meyer zu Horste et al.26 have 
reported that dysfunction of SCs leads to peripheral neuropathies, and Viader et al.27 have found that 
mitochondrial function in SCs is essential not only for neuronal survival but also for normal function of 
peripheral nerves. Similarly, glial cells have been shown to play a vital role for the growth and stability of 
developing synaptic structure as well as for proper functioning of neuromuscular junction28. With regard 
to nerve injury, it is well documented that SCs play a role in promoting recovery of the injured PNS by 
providing beneficial environment to the injured neurons29,30. SCs de-differentiate, proliferate, and form 
a Bands of Büngner at the injury site, by which they guide the regrowth of the proximal axons towards 
the target31. Our results, along with the previous reports, support the notion that SCs play an essential 
role in controlling the viability, axon growth, and perhaps the functions of MNs.

Our culture enables monitoring of the pre-myelinating and myelinating stages of SCs in vitro. Signals 
released from Schwann cells are critical for myelination of peripheral nerve fibers12. NRG1 (neuregulin) 
in the axonal membrane is essential for initiating the myelination process by binding to ErbB (erythro-
blastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog) family receptors expressed in SCs, and SC-derived signals are 
thought to primarily control the wrapping process of myelin around the axon. Among them, Krox20/Egr2  
(early growth response-2), which functions downstream of Sox10 (SRY-related HMGbox-10) and is acti-
vated by Oct6 (octamer-binding transcription factor-6), is essential for activating a number of myelin 
genes and maintaining the myelinated state by blocking inhibitors of myelination. Our results in Fig. 5 
show that Sox10 expression at DIV 7 preceded MBP expression, which was observed at DIV 10. The 
results in Fig. 6 also show a gradual increase of Krox20 first detected on DIV 7, followed by a strong 
expression  at  a  later  stage  (DIV  21).  At  later  stages,  MBP  was  highly  localized  along  the  axon  fibers 
(Fig.  7).  Our  findings  are  consistent  with  the  well-documented  hierarchy  of  SC  transcription  factors 
controlling myelination (reviewed by Pereira et al.12). In our culture, we were able to confirm the sequen-
tial process of myelination, which was initiated by migration of SCs toward axons, followed by further 
differentiation of SCs, as evidenced by increased expression of MBP. Finally, SCs wrapped around axons, 
leading to the formation of thick myelin sheaths.

In  the  present  study,  we  examined  the  efficacy  of  two  candidate  drugs,  which  we  thought,  might 
promote myelination of nerve fibers. We tested the effect of riluzole, a drug which is thought to protect 
neurons by decreasing the level of glutamate, and approved by FDA and clinically used for the treatment 
of ALS32. We also tested the effect of Co-Q10, a vitamin-like antioxidant substance that enhances ATP 
production in mitochondria. We found that while riluzole had no significant effect on myelination of MN 
axon fiber, Co-Q10 facilitated MBP expression and enhanced myelination. No positive effect of riluzole 
confirmed in our study could be explained within the context of the controversy about the efficacy of 
riluzole treatment of ALS33. SCs treated with Co-Q10 expressed MBP at an earlier stage (DIV 7), imply-
ing that Co-Q10 might accelerate myelination of nerve fibers. MNs seem to have higher energy demand 
and metabolic rate due to their increased mitochondrial activity in comparison to other neurons34. The

stimulating effect of Co-Q10 found in our study could be due to its ATP synthesizing ability as electron 
carriers35 or the antioxidant nature of Co-Q1036,37, or a combination of both. The exact mechanism and 
efficacy of Co-Q10 warrants further studies.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we report a simple and reproducible MN-SC coculture system derived from mouse neu-
rons  and  glia.  In  the  coculture,  SCs  enhanced  cell  viability  and  promoted  axonal  outgrowth  of  MNs. 
Moreover, SCs differentiated and transformed from pre-myelinating to myelinating stage as evidenced 
by  the  gradual  increase  in  MBP  expression  and  the  localization  of  MBP  signals  along  axon  fibers. 
Furthermore, using the MN-SC coculture, we show that Co-Q10 accelerates myelination.

Methods
Cell  Preparation.  Schwann  Cell  (SC)  Culture.  All  animal  experiments  have  been  conducted  in 
accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at 
the Korea Institute of Science and Technology. SCs were isolated from sciatic nerves of CD-1 mice (P4), 
as  previously  described6.  Explants  were  incubated  in  Ca2+-  and  Mg2+-free  phosphate-buffered  saline 
(PBS, Lonza) containing 0.05% trypsin (Sigma) and 0.05% collagenase A (Roche) for 30 min at 37 °C, 
followed by centrifugation at 190 g for 5 min. The pellets containing tissue fragments and cells were then 
washed three times with high glucose—DMEM (Gibco) containing 10% horse serum (HS) (Gibco). The 
harvested  SC  pellets  were  suspended  in  SC  basic  culture  medium  composed  of  high  glucose  DMEM, 
10% HS, 4 mM L-glutamine (L-gln, Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (P/S, Sigma), 2 ng/
ml human heregulin beta-1(Sigma), and 0.5 µ M forskolin (Sigma). After suspended, SCs were seeded on 
12 mmφ  coverslips at a density of 3 ×  104 cells per coverslip. Prior to seeding SCs, the coverslips were 
coated with growth factor-reduced matrigel (3 mm thickness on average). On DIV 4, complement-me-
diated cytolysis was performed to remove fibroblasts from the SC culture. Briefly, the cells were lightly 
washed  with  20 mM  HEPES  (T&I)  in  Ca2 + -  and  Mg2 + -free  HBSS  solution  (Invitrogen),  followed  by 
washing  with  HMEM  (high-glucose  DMEM  containing  20 mM  HEPES  buffer,  10%  HS,  4 mM  L-gln, 
100 units/ml P/S). After washing, 4 ng/ml anti-mouse CD90 (Serotec) in HMEM was added for 15 min 
at 37 °C, and 200 µ l of rabbit human leucocyte-associated antigens A, B, C (HLA-ABC) complement sera 
(Millipore) was added for 2 hrs at 37 °C. Cytolysis was terminated by washing cells with 20 mM HEPES

buffer in HBSS. After the cytolysis, SCs were cultured for another three days in the SC growth medium 
containing SC basic culture medium (described above) supplemented with 10 ng/ml of bFGF (Sigma) 
and 20 µ g/ml of bovine pituitary extract (Sigma) to promote cell proliferation.

Motor  Neuron  (MN)  Culture.  MNs  were  harvested  from  the  spinal  cord  of  CD-1  mice  (E14  fetus) 
as  previously  described24  with  some  modifications.  Ventral  horns  of  the  spinal  cord  (L1-L6  segment) 
were  each  collected  in  HBSS  and  1%  TLR  trypsin  (Worthington)  was  added  for  15  min  in  a  37 °C 
water bath before treating with 1% TLR trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). To extract a purified population of 
MNs,  cells  dissociated  from  the  explant  were  treated  for  45 min  at  room  temperature  with  a  selective 
immuno-panning  dish  prepared  with  p75NTR  antibody  solution  (1:5000,  Abcam)  in  10 mM  Tris-HCl 
(pH 9.5, T&I). Suspensions, including nerve fragments and p75NTR-negative cells, were removed from 
the panning dish by washing three times with pre-warmed neurobasal medium containing Glutamax 1 
(Gibco). MNs bound to the panning dish were then rinsed with depolarization solution containing 0.8% 
sodium chloride, 30 mM potassium chloride, and 2 mM calcium chloride (Merk) in distilled water for 
10 sec, and gently collected into the MN culture medium composed of neurobasal medium (Invitrogen), 
10% HS, Glutamax 1, B27 supplement (Gibco), 1 µ M β -mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and 10 ng/ml BDNF 
(Gibco).  MNs  were  collected  by  gentle  pipetting,  and  were  then  centrifuged  for  5 min  at  400 g.  After 
centrifugation, the pellets were re-suspended in the MN culture medium.

Coculture  of  MNs  and  SCs.  MNs  were  plated  (1 ×  104  cells/coverslip)  on  top  of  a  monolayer  of  SC 
culture  which  was  prepared  above  (Fig.  1B).  We  performed  that  MN  were  seeded  on  SC  feeder  layer 
on  which  SCs  cultured  on  growth  factor  reduced-matrigel  to  precede  both  migration  and  wrapping 
process of SCs around axons. In order to induce myelination, MN-SCs were first cultured in a coculture 
growth medium (neurobasal medium containing 2 ~ 10% HS, B27 supplement, 0.5 mM L-gln, 0.5 ~ 1 mM 
β -mercaptoethanol,  0.5 µ M  forskolin,  1  mg/ml  bovine  pituitary  extract,  10 ng/ml  BDNF)  for  7  days, 
after  which  25 ~ 50 µ g/ml  of  ascorbic  acid  (Sigma)  was  supplemented  for  the  subsequent  culture.  For 
MN  monoculture,  MNs  were  cultured  directly  on  matrigel-coated  coverslips  without  SC  feeder  layer 
(Fig.  1A).  For  drug  treatment,  cultures  were  treated  with  coenzyme  Q10  (Co-Q10,  1 µ M)  or  riluzole 
(0.1 µ M),  as  indicated.  At  24 hr  after  treatment,  samples  were  fixed  and  subjected  to  immunostaining 
with the indicated antibodies. All culture medium was replenished three times a week.

Measurement of Cell Viability.  Live-Dead cell staining kit was used according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions (Abcam). Briefly, after 0, 7, and 14 days of monoculture or 7, 14, and 21 days of coculture, 
samples were labeled with mixture of solution A (Live-Dye) and solution B (PI) in the staining buffer 
for 15 min at 37 °C. The samples were then washed once with the staining buffer and examined under 
Olympus IX71 with U-RFL-T (detects FITC and TRITC). For NeuN immunostaining, cells were fixed 
with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma), followed by blocking in 
4% BSA (Millipore) at 4 °C overnight. Cells were then labeled with NeuN antibody (1:500, Abcam) for 
24 hr  at  4 °C,  and  were  stained  with  Alexa  Fluor®   488  donkey  anti-mouse  IgG  (1:500,  Invitrogen)  for 
1 hr at room temperature, followed by DAPI (Life Technologies) staining. The number of stained cells 
was counted from five random fields (Live-Dead cell, NeuN staining) of view under the microscope and 
statistical analysis on the cell viability was performed.

Measurement of Axon Length.  Cultures were fixed and labeled for TuJ1 to visualize axons of MNs, 
and the lengths of axons (n =  100) were measured by using ImageJ software.

Immunocytochemistry.  After 7, 14, and 21 days of coculture, all samples were fixed with 4% para-
formaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min at room temperature and washed twice with PBS. The fixed samples were 
then soaked in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma), followed by 4% BSA (Millipore) at 4°C over-
night and labeled with primary antibodies, which included anti-Sox10 (1:500, Abcam), anti-s100β  (1:500, 
Abcam), anti-β -III Tubulin (Tuj1, 1:1000, Abcam), and anti-myelin basic protein (MBP, 1:500, Abcam). 
All samples with primary antibodies were incubated in 1% BSA with PBS at 4°C overnight. The samples 
were then washed with PBS containing 1% BSA twice, and incubated with goat anti-chicken IgY H&L 
(1:1000, Abcam), goat anti-rabbit IgG H&L (1:500, Abcam), or Alexa Fluor®  488 donkey anti-mouse IgG 
(1:500, Invitrogen). The nuclei of cells were stained with DAPI (Life Technologies) for 15 min at room 
temperature. Fluorescence of the culture was visualized under a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 700).

Western Blot Assays.  Expressions of MBP and Krox20 were quantitatively analyzed by using western 
blot analysis. The cells at DIV 1, 7, 14, and 21 were lysed in RIPA buffer containing 1% SDS and protease 
inhibitor (aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin A, PMSF). The protein concentration of cell lysates was meas-
ured by using Bradford assay. The samples were prepared in an SDS sample buffer, heated for 3 min at 
98 °C, and 6 µ g of the protein from each sample were loaded in SDS loading buffer and then transferred 
to a PVDF membrane. The membranes were blocked in 2.5% skim milk for 1 hr, followed by incubation 
with anti- rabbit Krox20 (1:1000, Abcam) or anti- rat MBP (1:500, Abcam) antibodies at 4 °C overnight. 
The membranes were washed three times in TBST and incubated with goat anti-rabbit and anti- rat IgG

conjugated  to  horseradish  peroxidase  (1:1000,  Sigma)  for  2  hrs.  Bands  were  visualized  by  using  ECL 
system. The intensity of the blots was quantified with ImageJ software.

Transmission Electron Microscopy.  At DIV 14, 21, cultures were fixed with 4% glutaraldehyde in 
PBS  and  stored  at  4 °C  overnight,  and  postfixed  with  1%  osmium  tetroxide  for  30 min.  Samples  were 
embedded  in  pre  epoxy  resin  before  dehydration  with  a  series  of  ethanol  solutions  (70%,  80%,  85%, 
90%,  95%,  100%).  Sections  were  taken  between  70 ~ 80 nm  using  Ultramicotome  (Leica,  Ultra  Cut  C) 
and picked up on Cu grids, stained in uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Images were acquired with the 
Cryo-TEM (FEI, CryoTecnai F20).

Quantitative Analysis of Pre-myelinating and Myelinating Schwann Cells.  During coculture, 
cultures  immunostained  with  anti-MBP  antibodies  showed  two  distinct  patterns  of  MBP  expression: 
pre-myelinating SCs showed relatively wide-spread expression of MBP adjacent to the axons while mye-
linating SCs showed highly localized expression of MBP along the axons. Cocultures were stained with 
MBP  and  TuJ1  at  DIV  10,  14,  and  21  and  the  proportion  of  these  two  types  was  calculated  from  six 
different fields of view under confocal microscope.

Statistical Analysis.  Average data are shown as mean ±  standard error and the comparison between 
different  groups  were  performed  by  using  repeated  measurement  analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA),  and 
statistical significance was set at a value of *P <  0.05, ***p <  0.001.
