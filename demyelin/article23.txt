Abstract 
The  human  genome  contains  remnants  of  ancestral  retroviruses  now  endogenously  transmitted,  called  human  endogenous  retroviruses 
(HERVs). HERVs can be variably expressed, and both beneficial and detrimental effects have described. This review focuses on the MSRV 
and syncytin-1 HERV-W elements in relationship to neurodegeneration in view of their neuro-pathogenic and immune-pathogenic properties. 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) and a neurodegenerative disease (neuroAIDS) are reported in this review. In vivo studies in patients and controls for 
molecular epidemiology and follow-up studies are reviewed, along with in vitro cellular studies of the effects of treatments and of molecular 
mechanisms. 
HERV-W/MSRV has been repeatedly found in MS patients (in blood, spinal fluid, and brain samples), and MRSV presence/load strikingly 
parallels MS stages and active/remission phases, as well as therapy outcome. The DNA of MS patients has increased MSRVenv copies, while 
syncytin-1 copies are unchanged in controls. Presence of MSRV in the spinal fluid predicted the worst MS progression, ten years in advance. 
The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) activates HERV-W/MSRV both in vitro and in vivo. With respect to neuroAIDS, the HIV transactivator of 
transcription  (Tat)  protein  activates  HERV-W/MSRV  in  monocytes/macrophages  and  astrocytes  indirectly  by  interaction  with  TLR4  and 
induction of TNF(cid:68). 
HERV-W/MSRV  can  be  considered  a  biomarker  for  MS  behavior  and  therapy  outcome.  Regarding  MS  pathogenesis,  we  postulate  the 
possibility for EBV of an initial trigger of future MS, years later, and for MSRV of a direct role of effector of neuropathogenesis during MS. 
Additionally, HERV-W/MSR/syncytin-1 activation by HIV Tat could contribute to the HIV-related neurodegeneration. 
 
Key words: endogenous retroviruses; HERV-W/MSRV/syncytin-1; multiple sclerosis; neuroAIDS.

Introduction 

are  now  endogenously  transmitted  and  are  hence 
called human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) [4-8]. 
Apart from ~3% of coding sequences, for an estimate 
of 20,000–25,000 genes [9], the vast majority of DNA 
is composed of introns, pseudogenes, duplications, and 
by at least 50% repeat sequences (including genes that 
encode  ribosomal  components,  minisatellite  DNA, 
HERVs,  and  probably  much  more)  [6,9,10-11]. 
HERVs are grouped in 26–31 independently acquired 
families  or  lineages  [12-13].  They  are  poorly  and 
variably  expressed,  being  highly  defective,  but  a 
handful  of  complete  proviruses  have  been  described, 
having 
the  classical  genome  organization  of  a 
retrovirus, i.e., two long terminal repeat (LTR) regions 
including  the gag  (capsidic  group-associated  antigen, 
the  structural  matrix,  capsid,  and 
coding 
nucleocapsid  proteins),  pol 
(polymerase/protease, 
coding  for  the  reverse  transcriptase,  integrase  and 
protease  proteins),  and env  (envelope,  coding  for  the 
envelope surface and transmembrane proteins) genes. 

for 

Human  DNA  contains  a  large  amount  of  "alien" 
material, since an average of 8% of all our DNA is of 
retroviral  origin  [1].  It  is  well  known  that  retrovirus 
replication  requires  provirus  integration  into  the  host 
DNA  and 
that  the  integrated  provirus  becomes 
functionally  indistinguishable  from  host  sequences, 
behaving 
thereafter  as  a  heritable  cellular  gene 
transmitted  to  progeny  cells.  If  the  progeny  cells  are 
germline  cells,  this  endogenous  infection  can  be 
through  generations.  This 
transmitted  vertically 
process  is  ongoing 
in  koalas,  where  the  koala 
retrovirus, which is associated with neoplasias, shows 
features  of  transition  between  an  exogenous  and 
endogenous vertically transmitted element [2-3]. This 
phenomenon  occurred  repeatedly  in  our  progenitors, 
with 
reinfections,  and 
rearrangements of the sequences. Nevertheless, similar 
to  other  animal  species,  the  human  genome  contains 
remnants  of many different kinds  of retroviruses that

types  of 
mutations occurred, and deleted or mutated versions of 
inactive  retroelements  accumulated  in  the  genome. 
While  some  transposable  elements  became  inactive, 
others  retained  mobility  within the  genome.  Variably 
inserting  in  cellular  genes,  and  differentially  within 
allotypes  of  polymorphic  genes,  these  elements  may 
have determined inheritable, stable gene modifications 
[6].  Reinfection  by  replication-competent  elements, 
complementation  in  trans,  retrotransposition  in  cis, 
and 
are 
mechanisms  used  in  most  families  [12].  In  addition, 
through their LTRs, they may supply new promoters, 
create  new  functional  exons,  alternative  splicing 
products  and  miRNAs  via  integration  and  adaption 
events,  thus  contributing  to  genome  plasticity  during 
evolution [14]. 

non-HERV  machinery 

copying 

The  host  occasionally  takes  advantage  of  the 
presence  of  these  ancestrally  transmitted  foreign 
genomes  to  serve  physiological  functions;  several 
possible  beneficial  effects  have  been  reported  [6], 
including  embryo 
implantation,  gene  variability, 
alternative  splicing  and  polyadenylation,  mother’s 
immunosuppression  to  protect  the  fetal  allograft, 
protection  against 
superinfection  by  exogenous 
retroviruses,  and  involvement  in  development  and/or 
differentiation.  Conversely,  HERVs  can  contribute  to 
the  generation  of  inherited  diseases  by  induction  of 
gene  instability  and  variability,  recombination,  gene 
disruption  by 
sequences, 
autoimmunity,  superantigenic  stimulation,  production 
through 
of 
interactions 
and 
activation/inactivation  of  growth  controlling  genes 
[6,15].

insertion  of  HERV 

Increasing  evidence  shows  links  of  HERVs  with 
infertility, 
some  human  diseases,  such  as  male 
schizophrenia,  and  cancer 
[6,10-11,16].  Several 
studies reported expression of one or more HERVs in 
physiological  or  pathological  conditions,  in  one  or 
more body sites. A key problem is differentiating this 
expression  as  the  cause  or  effect  of  a  particular 
disease.  While  for  various  HERV  families,  only 
expression of transcripts (and rarely of proteins) [6,15] 
were  reported  for  the  HERV-W  family;  several 
independent studies went further, reproducing in vitro 
and  in  animal  models  pathogenic  mechanisms  of  the 
linked disease. 
The HERV-W family: MSRV and syncytin-1 

The  most  studied  HERV  family  is  HERV-W. 
There  have  been  two  milestone  discoveries  about 

by 

 

released 

virions), 

infectious 

HERV-W:  the  discovery  of  its  founder  member,  the 
multiple sclerosis (MS)-associated retrovirus (MSRV, 
a presumably complete virus,  since it is able to form 
extracellular, 
by 
leptomeningeal  cells  of  MS  patients  [16-17],  and  the 
discovery  that  syncytin-1  (a  protein  expressed  in 
human placenta during pregnancy), is encoded by the 
env  gene  of  ERVWE1,  a  replication-incompetent 
HERV-W  element  located  on  human  chromosome 
7q21-22  [7,18]  that  has  inactivating  mutations  in  the 
gag  and pol  genes  and is  not  able  to  form  virus-like 
particles. In human DNA, there are multiple copies of 
HERV-W  elements;  numbers  can  vary  [19-20],  but 
there are about 70 gag, 100 pro, and 30 env HERV-W-
related regions [21-22]; the family is retrotransposably 
active  [12]  and  generates  new  recombinant  copies  in 
cancer  cells  [23].  Full-length  HERV-Wenv  DNA 
sequences are present on ten human chromosomes (X, 
3, 4, 5, 7, 12, 14, 15, 17, and 18), and three additional 
chromosomes  have  HERV-W  elements  containing 
incomplete HERV-Wenvs spanning ≥ 80% of the gene 
[24].  As  for  their  transcription,  only  the  ERVW-1 
locus on chromosome 7 is transcribed in a full-length 
env  mRNA  that  can  be  translated  in  a  complete 
protein,  syncytin-1;  all  the  other  HERV-Wenv  genes 
present  in  the  current  version  of  the  human  genome 
either  are  not  transcribed,  or  originate  HERV-Wenv 
fragments with stop codons and other gene alterations 
[24]. 

In  the  case  of  syncytin-1,  the  host  subverts  the 
usual situation in which viruses use the cells for their 
own  advantage 
(replication  or  persistence);  for 
example,  the  host  uses  these  ancestrally  transmitted 
viral  genomes  for  pivotal  physiological  functions 
during pregnancy. In fact, syncytin-1 is responsible for 
the  fusion  of  fetal  trophoblasts  into  the  placental 
syncytiotrophoblast  layer,  which  allows  for  embryo 
implantation  [25].  Other  relevant  functions  that  have 
been  hypothesized  are  the  powerful  transcriptional 
regulatory  properties  of  HERV-W  LTRs  and  the 
possible role of HERV-Wenv expression in pregnancy 
in suppressing the maternal immune response against 
the fetal allograft [26-27]. 

None  of  the  known  stably  inserted  HERV-W 
elements is replication competent; a study of HERV-
W  intragenomic  spread  confirmed  that,  in  the  few 
individuals  used  for  genome-wide  analysis, 
the 
sequenced  HERV-W  elements  lacked  intact  open 
reading  frames  (ORFs)  in  all  genes  within  a  single 
copy  [22].  Syncytin-1  originates  from  the  ERVWE1 
element on chromosome 7; the origin of MSRV is still 
debated [16]. Sequencing of virionic MSRV genomes

identified 
7,630-nucleotide-long 
reconstituted  retroviral  organization  with  RU5,  gag, 
pol,  env,  and  U3R  regions  [16].  These  sequences 
belong  to  the  HERV-W  family  [18],  classified  in 
(simple)  Gammaretroviruses  [13].  MSRV  might  be 
either  an  exogenous  HERV-W,  or  a  non-ubiquitous 
replication-competent  member,  or  a  partly  defective, 
seldom  complemented  or 
non-ubiquitous  copy, 
recombined  within 
[24]. 
Whatever  the  origin  of  MSRV,  ~9%  of  healthy 
Caucasians have circulating virionic MSRV/HERV-W 
RNA [16]. 
MSRVenv  and  syncytin-1  are  closely  related  and 
difficult to distinguish from each other [26]. A major 
difference  is  that  only  MSRV  is  found  as  complete 
extracellular  virus,  while  syncytin-1  is  found  only 
intracellularly or on the plasma membrane [16]. At the 
protein  level,  no  antibodies  discriminating  MSRVenv 
and  syncytin-1  are  yet  available  [28].  At  the  RNA 
level, MSRVenv and syncytin-1 have 94% similarity; 
we  observed  that  MSRVenv  sequences  have  a  12-
nucleotide  insertion  in  the  trans-membrane  moiety 
[29].  Based  on 
insertion,  we  developed 
discriminatory  real-time  polymerase  chain  reaction 
(PCR)  assays  that  can  amplify  selectively  either 
MSRVenv or syncytin-1 [29]. 
MSRVenv  and  syncytin-1  proteins  share  several 
biological  features,  and  are  potentially  pathogenic. 
They  have  pro-inflammatory  and  superantigenic 
properties,  and  have  been shown to  cause  neurotoxic 
effects  in  vitro  and  in  human  or  transgenic  animal 
models 
cause 
neuroinflammation,  neurodegeneration,  alterations  of 
the  immune  system,  and  stress  responses;  both  have 
been  suggested  as  co-factors  triggering  the  immuno-
pathogenesis  of  MS.  Expression  of  HERV-
W/MSRV/syncytin-1  occurs  in  astrocytes  of  MS 
lesions in the brain [31-32], as  well as in endothelial 
and microglial cells [33]. Of note, in the brains of mice 
with  a  syncytin  construct  stereotactically  implanted 
into  the  corpus  callosum,  oligodendrocytes  (which 
produce the myelin sheath of the nerve) were shown to 
be  sensitive  to  syncytin-1-mediated  release  of  redox 
reactants  from  astrocytes  [31].  Notably,  MSRVenv 
alone  was  shown  to  promote  experimental  allergic 
encephalomyelitis in mice, the animal model of human 
MS [34].

MS is  a  chronic  neurological disease that usually 
begins  in  early  adulthood  and  leads  to  progressive 
neurodegeneration.  It  causes  repeated  unpredictable

abnormalities 
impairment,  with 
demyelination  and  gliosis,  various  degrees  of  axonal 
pathology,  and  episodic  or  progressive  neurological 
disability [35]. The etiology of MS is complex but still 
unclear.  The  immuno-pathogenic  phenomena  leading 
to  neurodegeneration  are  thought  to  be  triggered  by 
environmental  or  viral  factors,  operating  on  a 
predisposing  genetic  background,  and  result  from  an 
inflammatory  process 
that,  among  other  effects, 
attacks  and  destroys  oligodendrocytes,  the  cells  that 
form the myelin sheaths around axons in the brain and 
spinal cord.  

real-time 

quantitative 

Among  the  HERVs  associated  with  MS,  MSRV 
has  been  the  most  intensely  studied,  followed  by 
syncytin-1. However, due to the sequence similarities, 
effective  distinction  between  the  two  elements  by 
discriminatory 
reverse 
transcription (RT)-PCR assays was carried out only by 
our  group  [24,28-29,36]  and  later  on,  with  the  same 
assay, by Perron et al. [37]. With the aid of these real-
time PCR assays, which can amplify selectively either 
MSRVenv or syncytin-1 [29], we found that the DNA 
of  MS  patients  had  increased  MSRVenv  copies 
(sixfold mean increase, p = 0.02), while the syncytin-
1-specific assay gave almost identical mean values for 
both patients and controls [29]. 

To  date,  the  presence  of  extracellular  MSRV 
particles  in  MS  patients  and  the  expression  of 
MSRVenv  and  syncytin-1 
transcripts  have  been 
detected independently in the blood and the brain by 
several  groups,  and  found  to  be  increased  in  both 
healthy  and  pathological  controls  [6,15-16],  and 
shown in Figure 1 for our Sardinian cohort.

MSRV  was  detected  in  100%  of  patients  with  active 
MS (but in 33% of MS patients in remitting phase, as 
reported  in  Figure  2);  moreover,  the  presence  of 
MSRV  particles  in  spinal fluid  was  found  to  parallel 
temporal and clinical progression of the disease [39].  
levels  of 
MSRV/HERV-Wenv transcripts are similar in samples 
from normal controls (autopsied tissues from subjects 
with non-neurological diseases), and from pathological 
controls 
from  patients  with  non-MS 
neurological diseases), without significant differences

lesion  edge,  HERV-W 

A  large  multicentric  study  of  MS  patients  and 
neurological  and  healthy  controls  from  different 
European areas showed that MSRV presence and load 
in blood and spinal fluid was significantly associated 
with  MS  in  all  ethnic  groups  (p  <  0.05  compared  to 
neurological controls and < 0.001 compared to healthy 
controls)  [40].  MRSV  presence/load  in  MS  patients 
strikingly  paralleled  disease  behavior;  we  detected 
direct parallelisms  between MSRV positivity/load (in 
blood,  spinal  fluid,  and  brain  samples)  and  MS 
temporal 
as 
active/remission  phases  (Figure  2).  MSRV  positivity 
of spinal fluids increased with MS duration [39], and 
its  presence  in  early  MS  was  related  to  worse 
prognosis in the next ten years. A blind observational 
study  of  early  MS  patients  starting  in  comparable 

as  well 

clinical 

stages, 

and 

conditions  (but  differing  in  MSRV  positivity  in  the 
spinal fluid) confirmed that the presence of MSRV in 
the  cerebrospinal  fluid  of  early  MS  patients  was 
associated with a significantly greater rate of disability 
and  disease  progression,  since  after  three  [41],  six 
[42],  and  ten  years  [43],  mean  disability,  annual 
relapse  rate,  therapy  requirement,  and  progression  to 
secondary-progressive MS were significantly higher in 
patients  starting  with  MSRV-positive  spinal  fluids 
(Figure  3).  Hence,  we  proposed  that  evaluation  of 
plasmatic  MSRV  could  be  considered 
the  first 
prognostic marker for the individual patient to monitor 
disease  progression.  Our  proposal  was  reinforced  by 
the  study  of  patients  with  optic  neuritis,  a  disease 
frequently  prodromic  to  MS;  in  the  blood  and  in  the 
spinal  fluid  of  these  patients,  MSRV  positivity  was 
significantly  higher  than  in  that  of  pathological 
controls,  and the  conversion  to  full-blown  MS in the 
next 20 months occurred only among MSRV-positive 
patients [44].

providing a pathogenic amplification loop. 

Next,  we  verified  whether  MSRV  expression 
varies  in  MS  patients  during  therapy.  A  longitudinal 
evaluation  of  MS  patients  during  efficacious  therapy 
with  interferon-β  revealed  that  MSRV  viremia  fell 
rapidly below detection limits (the earliest effect was 
detected  48  hours  after  the  first  drug  inoculation); 
notably, a patient, after initial clinical and virological 
benefit,  had  MSRV  rescue,  preceding  strong  disease 
progression  and  therapy  failure  [47].  Our  findings 
were  confirmed  by  an  independent  follow-up  study 
that  observed  significant  decreases  in  anti-HERV-
Wenv  and  anti-HERV-Henv  antibody  reactivity  as  a 
consequence of interferon-β therapy, closely linked to 
efficacy  of  therapy/low  disease  activity  [48].  In

The viral trigger of MS pathogenesis and the 
dual virus hypothesis 

Several  viruses  have  been  proposed  as  co-factors 
of  MS  [50-51].  Among  them,  there  were  some 
members  of the family of Herpesviridae, such as the 
human herpesvirus  6 (HHV-6) [52], and the Epstein-
Barr  virus 
[53],  along  with  HERV-
W/MSRV/syncytin-1 [16,50,54]. 

(EBV) 

With  respect  to  HHV-6,  meta-analyses  provided 
some support for a link between HHV-6 and MS, but 
none  showed  causative  relationships,  and  findings 
across the field are non-uniform [52]. Since we found 
significant increases of the expression of HERV-W in

MS  patients,  we  evaluated  the  expression  of  both 
HERV-Ws  and  HHV-6  within  the  same  samples  of 
brain and blood cells of MS patients and controls, as 
the  mere  detection  of  HHV-6  would  not  imply  viral 
activity.  This  is  particularly  important  for  HHV-6 
studies,  as  the  vast  majority  of  reports  have  detected 
virus  DNA,  and  the  need  for  studies  to  examine 
antigen and virus mRNA expression in MS and control 
brains to delineate the relationship between latent and 
active  virus  and  MS  has  been  emphasized  [52].  By 
evaluating  two  different  transcripts  for  each  virus 
(MSRV/HERV-W  env  and  pol,  HHV-6  U94/rep, 
which  maintains  the  latent  state,  and  DNA-pol, 
indicative of actively replicating virus), we found that 
MSRV/HERV-W  was  expressed  actively  in  human 
brains and activated strongly in MS patients (up to the 
protein 
there  were  no  significant 
differences between these MS patients and controls for 
HHV-6  presence/replication  at  the  brain  or  PBMC 
level [32]. 

level),  while 

More  consistent  studies 

for  potential  virus 
involvement in MS exist for EBV [53], as the risk of 
developing  MS  is  higher  among  individuals  infected 
with  EBV,  especially  if  the  EBV  infection  occurs  in 
late  adolescence  or  adulthood,  when  the  infection  is 
symptomatic.  A  meta-analysis  showed  an  association 
between  the  appearance  of  anti-EBV  antibodies  and 
the onset of MS 5–20 years later [55]; another paper 
reported that the relative risk of MS for a past history 
of  infectious  mononucleosis  (IM)  is  2.17  [56].  The 
MS-EBV  link  remains  unclear  and  seems  to  be 
indirect, since no studies have found evidence of EBV 
expression  specific  to  MS,  and  currently  there  is  no 
consensus in establishing whether there is a presence 
of  EBV-infected  cells  in  the  central  nervous  system 
(CNS) of MS patients [57]. Therefore, it remains to be 
determined whether EBV continues to play a role after 
disease initiation [24,36]. 
In  search  of  EBV/HERV-W/MSRV/syncytin-1 
links,  we  studied  in  vitro  the  expression  of  HERV-
W/MSRV/syncytin-1,  with  or  without  exposure  to 
EBV  or  to  EBV  glycoprotein350  (EBVgp350,  the 
major  envelope  protein),  on  PBMC  from  healthy 
volunteers  and  MS  patients,  and  on  astrocytes,  by 
discriminatory  env-specific  real-time  RT-PCR  assays 
and  by  flow  cytometry  [24].  We  verified  whether 
HERV-W  might  be  activated  also 
in 
hospitalized  young  adults  with  IM  symptoms,  and  in 
healthy  controls  that  were  either  EBV  negative  or 
latently  EBV  infected  with  or  without  high  titers  of 
anti-EBNA-1 IgG [24,36]. Briefly, the results showed

trigger of future MS, years later, and that MSRV has a 
direct role as effector of neuropathogenesis before and 
during MS [24,36].

The  central  nervous  system  (CNS)  is  a  major 
target  for  the  human  immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV) 
[58-60]. HIV neuroinvasion in vivo occurs within the 
first  month  [61],  and  this  early  compartmentalization 
suggests  a  CNS  reservoir  for  local  virus  production 
[62].  The  neurodegenerative  disease  (neuroAIDS) 
progresses

neurocognitive,  behavioral,  and  motor  impairments 
that  can  lead  to  full-blown  HIV-associated  dementia 
[58].  The  mechanisms  by  which  HIV  causes 
neurodegeneration  are  not  fully  elucidated,  and 
include  both  host  and  viral  mechanisms  [28,63]. 
Additional  relevant  contributions  to  neuroAIDS  are 
caused  by  reactivation  of  bystander  latent/persistent 
viruses  with  neurotropic  potential  such  as  EBV, 
cytomegalovirus,  and  JC  polyomavirus,  which  can

Since 10% of healthy Caucasian release MSRV in 
the  blood  [16],  we  wondered  whether  MSRV  and 
syncytin-1 are activated by HIV and thus whether their 
neuropathogenic  and  immunopathogenic  properties 
could  contribute  to  HIV-related  neurodegeneration 
[28].  In  fact,  rather  than  HIV  itself,  as  the  virus 
production  is  too  low  to  explain  the  extensive  CNS 
disease  often  observed,  mechanisms  of  amplification 
of  toxicity  and  inflammation  in  response  to  HIV 
infection  were  suggested  as  a  major  cause  of 
neurological disease [64]. To this end, we exposed to 
HIV,  or  to  its  transactivator  of  transcription  (Tat) 
protein,  monocytes/macrophages  and  astrocytes,  i.e., 
the cells that are thought to be more relevant for HIV-
related neurodegeneration [28].

infection  and 
exposure  to  Tat  increase  the  levels  of  MSRVenv 
mRNAs  and  HERV-Wenv  proteins  in  astrocytes  and 
in  blood  cells.  In  monocyte-macrophages,  Tat  also 
induces  high  levels  of  CCR2,  CD16,  and  Toll-like 
receptor 4 (TLR4) molecules. Interestingly, syncytin-1 
response  to  Tat  depends  on  the  cell  context:  in 
monocytes,  Tat  stimulates  MSRVenv  and  inhibits 
syncytin-1,  while  in  differentiated  macrophages  and 
primary astrocytes, Tat stimulates both elements [28]. 
Experiments  were  performed  to  give  insights  on 
the  mechanisms  by  which  Tat  regulates  MSRV  and 
syncytin-1.  It  is  known  that  TNFα  is  the  most

Tat  internalization  by  exposed  cells  is  not  required 
[28]. In primary astrocytes, Tat stimulates MSRV and 
syncitin-1 
interaction  with  TLR4  and 
induction  of  TNFα,  as  reported  on  Figure  5.  The 
indirect mechanism by which Tat activates HERV-Ws 
by  TNFα  induction  could  be  a  new  property  of  this 
pleiotropic  protein.  The  in  vivo  consequence  of  the 
study  could  be  that,  through  increase  of  CD16  and 
CCR2,  Tat  promotes  neuroinvasion  by  HIV-infected 
monocytes/macrophages, but also by HERV-Ws, with 
their neuropathogenic potential. Within the brain, Tat-
induced TNFα could induce high levels of HERV-Ws, 
in both macrophages and astrocytes, also without HIV 
replication. 
 

Figure 5. Cartoon of the proposed mechanism of MSRV and syncytin-1 activation by HIV Tat in human astrocytes 

(1) HIV Tat bind<s the TLR4-MD2 complex on the membrane; this activates TNFα transcription, by two main pathways (NF-κB through the TRIF-
dependent pathway and/or through a MyD88-dependent pathway). (2) The two pathways lead to proteasomal degradation of IκBs (inhibitor of κB), 
allowing  NF-κB  translocation  into  the  nucleus.  (3)  Consequent  innate  immune  response,  with  production  of  TNFα  and  others  proinflammatory 
cytokines.  (4)  The  released  TNFα  binds  to  TNF  receptor  (TNFR),  to  initiate  a  second  run  of  NF-κB  activation  in  a  autocrine  (not  shown)  and 
paracrine manner. (5) The signalling pathway downstream TNFR leads to nuclear translocation of NF-κB, where it binds to the promoters of syncytin-
1 and MSRV, hence (6) activating the production/release of the corresponding env proteins and MSRV particles. (7) Cytoplasmatic accumulation of 
env  proteins  induces  endoplasmic  reticulum  (ER)  stress  responses;  extracellular  or  transmembrane  env  proteins  can  exert  their  properties: 
fusogenicity, capacity to activate the neuroimmune system, to damage oligodendrocytes and interfere with myelin regeneration, etc. For details, see 
[28].

Concluding remarks 

HERVs  constitute  a  significant  part  of  our 
genome,  and  were  passed  successfully  over  10–60 
million years in the genome of our ancestors. Mutual 
adaptation must have occurred, and in some cases, the 
host  turned  to  his  own  use  some  of  these  foreign 
genomes  to  serve  physiological  functions,  as  in  the 
case  of  HERV-W/syncytin-1,  a  mediator  of  the 
formation of the syncytiotrophoblast layer during early 
pregnancy.  Over  time,  some  retroelements  may  have 
originated  positive  genetic  variability,  but  also 
inheritable or inducible diseases.  

In  patients  with  MS,  HERV-W/MSRV  can  be 
considered a biomarker for MS behavior and therapy 
outcome.  As  for  MS  pathogenesis,  we  postulate  the 
possibility that EBV is an initial trigger of future MS, 
and  that  MSRV  has  a  direct  role  of  effector  of 
neuropathogenesis  during  MS. 
In  HIV-infected 
patients, HERV-W/MSR/syncytin-1 activation by HIV

contribute 

A key problem when evaluating the expression is 
differentiating  whether  it  is  the  cause  or  effect  of  a 
particular disease or physiological condition. 

The links of some HERVs to human diseases are 
increasingly observed, particularly those characterized 
by multifactorial etiology and/or dysregulated immune 
functions, and there is hope for identifying new targets 
for innovative therapeutic interventions.
