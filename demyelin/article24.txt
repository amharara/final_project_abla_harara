Workshop: New perspectives in MS, NMO, and PML
Signiﬁcance of gray matter brain lesions in multiple

sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica

Multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO) are
the two main autoimmune diseases of the CNS. In patients
with NMO, the target antigen is aquaporin-4 (AQP4), the
most abundant water channel protein in the CNS. AQP4 is
mainly expressed on astrocytic endfoot processes at the
blood-brain barrier and in subpial and subendymal regions.
MS and NMO are distinct diseases, but they have some com-
mon clinical features: both have long been considered auto-
immune diseases that primarily affect the white matter
(WM). However, because WM demyelination by itself
cannot explain the full extent of the clinical disabilities,
including cognitive decline in patients with MS and NMO,
renewed interest in gray matter (GM) pathology in MS
and NMO is emerging. Important hallmarks of WM and
GM lesions in MS and NMO may differentially inﬂuence
neuronal degeneration and demyelination in the brain and
spinal cord, given different detrimental effects, including
cytokine diffusion, disruption of water homeostasis associ-
ated with or without AQP4 (the target antigen in NMO)
dynamics, or other unidentiﬁed mechanisms. An increase
in knowledge of the structure of GM and WM lesions in
MS and NMO will result in more targeted therapeutic
approaches to these two diseases.

Key words: gray matter lesions, neurodegeneration, neuromy-
elitis optica, multiple sclerosis, white matter lesions.

INTRODUCTION

Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and multiple sclerosis (MS)
are the two main autoimmune diseases of the CNS typically
following a relapsing and remitting course.1,2 In patients
with NMO, the speciﬁc autoantibody targets the water chan-
nel aquaporin-4 (AQP4).3,4 Details of the disease mecha-
nisms, pathology and clinical characteristics of NMO have
emerged. Currently, NMO is widely recognized as a distinct,

relapsing, autoimmune disease that can be distinguished
from MS based on epidemiological, clinical, radiological, im-
munological and pathological evidence.2,5,6 NMO is charac-
terized by three major lesions:2,5 (i) myelopathy in NMO is
associated with spinal cord lesions detected with MRI that
extend more than three spinal segments (longitudinally ex-
tensive spinal cord lesions (LEM)) and that primarily in-
volve the central part of the spinal cord on axial sections5,7;
(ii) optic neuritis in NMO is bilateral and severe and is asso-
ciated with swollen optic nerves, a chiasmatic lesion, or an al-
titudinal scotoma, as well as a thin retinal nerve ﬁber layer
that is observed with optical coherence tomography5,8; and
(iii) periaqueductal medullary lesions in NMO are associ-
ated with intractable hiccoughs or nausea/vomiting that are
present for > 2 days.5,9 More recently, supratentorial lesions
have been reported in NMO including extensive white mat-
ter (WM) lesions,10 cortical gray matter (GM) lesions,11
brainstem lesions, or cerebellar lesions. Thus, CNS lesions
in NMO may be much more widespread than previously
thought. To address the region-speciﬁc and disease-speciﬁc
mechanisms of NMO and MS pathogenesis in the CNS, we
summarized and reviewed the current concepts of WM and
GM lesions in NMO and MS and further clariﬁed some con-
troversial issues (Fig. 1).6,11–13

GM INVOLVEMENT IN MS

MS has long been considered an autoimmune disease that
primarily affects the WM. However, because WM demye-
lination by itself cannot explain the full extent of clinical
disabilities, including cognitive decline in patients with
MS, renewed interest in GM pathology in MS14,15 is
emerging.

From a historical perspective, GM lesions in MS were
disregarded for a long time since their description by the
neuropathologist James W. Dawson in 1916.16 In 1962,
Brownell et al. reported that among a total of 1594 cerebral
plaques in 22 postmortem MS brains, 80 (5%), 65 (4%), 265
(17%) and 1184 (74%) plaques were found in cortical GM,
central GM, the junction of cortical GM and WM and
WM, respectively, according to pathological assessment

Fig. 1 Models of lesion formation in multiple sclerosis (MS) (A) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO) (B). Demyelination in cortical gray matter
(GM) is evident in MS (A), but not in NMO (B). The pathological hallmarks of cortical GM lesions in MS are largely restricted to demyelin-
ation, subtle neuroaxonal degeneration, transection of neurites, and synaptic loss. On the other hand, cortical GM lesions are evident in NMO
brains and are distinct from lesions in MS brains. Neuropathological assessment has demonstrated neuronal loss in cortical layers II, III and IV
with nonlytic reaction of aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-negative astrocytes in layer I, massive activation of microglia in layer II and meningeal inﬂam-
mation in NMO brains. No NMO cases showed evidence of cortical GM demyelination or ectopic B-cell follicle-like structures in the meninges.
These data indicate that pathological processes consist not only of inﬂammatory demyelinating events characterized by pattern-speciﬁc loss of
AQP4 immunoreactivity in the spinal cord and optic nerves, but also cortical neurodegeneration in NMO brains.

using conventional myelin staining such as Luxol Fast-Blue
or Klüver-Barrera staining.17 Recent studies using more
sensitive immunohistochemical staining with antibodies
against myelin basic protein, myelin oligodendrocyte glyco-
protein, or proteolipid protein demonstrated that GM de-
myelination was much more extensive in patients with MS
than previously thought.18

Cortical GM demyelination in MS is classiﬁed into four
lesion types:19,20 Type I lesions are mixed GM/WM lesions;
Type II lesions are located within the cortical GM and do
not extend to the surface of the brain; Type III lesions are
subpial lesions, which reach from the pia downwards into
the cortical GM but do not reach the WM-GM border; and
Type IV lesions extend throughout the full width of the cor-
tical GM, but do not reach into the subcortical WM.19,20
Pathological studies using postmortem samples have shown
that the percentages of total demyelinated lesions are 14%,
1%, 67% and 17% in Types I, II, III and IV, respectively.19
A pathological study using biopsy samples in a cohort of
patients with early-stage MS, including deﬁnite MS and clin-
ically isolated syndrome, indicated that cortical demyelin-
ation is also evident in 38% of samples and that the
percentages of total demyelinated lesions are 50%, 16%,
34% and 0%, in Types I, II, III and IV, respectively.14
Band-like subpial demyelination (Type III lesion) is invari-
ably oriented toward the pial surface of the cortex and pen-
etrates into the cortex at variable depths, is particularly

widespread in deep infoldings of the brain surface, affects
the largest cortical areas and several adjacent gyri, is associ-
ated with inﬂammatory inﬁltrates in the meninges, and is
mainly found in patients with secondary progressive (SPMS)
or primary progressive MS (PPMS).21 On the other hand,
Type I or II lesions are present in all stages and courses of
MS,
including acute MS, relapsing and remitting MS
(RRMS), PPMS and SPMS.21 The pathology of cortical
GM lesions is distinct from that of WM lesions in MS brains;15
the typical pathological hallmarks of WM lesions, including
lymphocyte and macrophage inﬁltration, complement depo-
sition, microglial activation, and blood-brain barrier disrup-
in cortical GM lesions.19,20,22,23
tion, are all unusual
However, these differences may be dependent on lesion
stage, because most of the cortical demyelination in pa-
tients with early-stage MS shows parenchymal inﬂamma-
inﬁltrates and
tory inﬁltrates
macrophage-associated demyelination with meningeal
inﬂammation,14 which was much more extensive than
previously thought in cohorts of most patients with SPMS
or PPMS.19,20,22,23 A focal experimental autoimmune
encephalitis model of cortical demyelination, which is in-
duced by stereotactically targeting the cerebral cortex by
injecting proinﬂammatory mediators into myelin oligoden-
drocyte glycoprotein-sensitized rats, shows more rapid res-
olution of inﬂammation and more extensive remyelination
of GM demyelination compared to WM demyelination.24

More recently, a clear gradient of neuronal loss was evident
not only in GM demyelination but also in normal-
appearing GM when accompanied by meningeal B-cell
follicle-like structures.25 These data indicate that some
neurodegeneration in the cortex may be independent of
demyelination and may more diffusely occur.25

Deep GM demyelination is also present in patients with
MS, as shown by pathological assessment of postmortem
brains.26,27 Deep GM demyelination is most often seen in
the thalamus, hypothalamus and caudate nuclei, but is also
present in the putamen, pallidum, claustrum, amygdala and
substantia nigra. Deep GM inﬂammation is intermediate
between low inﬂammatory cortical lesions and active WM
lesions.27 The deep GM in MS shows not only focal
demyelinated plaques, but also diffuse neurodegeneration27
analogous with cortical GM lesions. Moreover, non-
neocortical lesions with prominent GM pathology are also
present in the hippocampus.28 Demyelinated hippocampi
show minimal neuronal loss, but signiﬁcant decreases in syn-
aptic density. Neuronal proteins essential for axonal trans-
port,
synaptic plasticity, glutamate neurotransmission,
glutamate homeostasis and memory, are signiﬁcantly de-
creased in demyelinated hippocampi, but not in demyelinated
motor cortices in MS brains.28

Conventional MRI are usually not optimal for detecting
cortical GM lesions in MS brains.29 Recently, a multi-slab
three-dimensional (3D) double inversion recovery (DIR)
technique has been developed and has enabled around a
ﬁve-fold increase in the detection of cortical GM lesions in
MS brains compared to conventional MRI.15,29–34 However,
in a postmortem veriﬁcation study, 3D-DIR detected only
9.1% of all intracortical GM lesions (Types II, III and IV le-
sions) that were identiﬁed with pathological methods, sug-
gesting that 3D-DIR has poor sensitivity for detecting
intracortical GM lesions, although it has excellent patholog-
ical speciﬁcity.31 Importantly, band-like subpial demyelin-
ation (Type III lesions), which is the most common type of
cortical GM lesion in MS autopsied brains, is still undetect-
able with DIR sequences.30,31 Future radiological assess-
ment methods are needed to improve the detection of
cortical GM lesions.6

GM INVOLVEMENT IN NMO

NMO is an autoimmune astrocytopathy characterized by se-
vere attacks of optic neuritis and LEM.3,4 The target antigen
in patients with NMO is AQP4,3,4 the most abundant water
channel protein in the CNS that is mainly expressed on as-
trocytic endfoot processes at the blood-brain barrier and in
subpial and subependymal regions.35 Historically, severe
optic neuritis and LEM with a negative brain MRI are con-
sidered common features of NMO.7 LEM primarily involves
central GM.5,35 However, increasing evidence indicates that

typical/atypical MS-type brain lesions are present
in
NMO.10,36–40 Sixty percent of NMO patients have brain
abnormalities on MRI, most of which are nonspeciﬁc.
However, 10% have MS-typical
lesions, and 8% have
MS-atypical lesions such as diencephalic, brainstem or cere-
bral lesions.10 Moreover, magnetization transfer and diffu-
sion tensor MRI studies of patients with NMO have found
abnormalities in normal-appearing GM as well as normal
ﬁndings or minimal changes in normal-appearing WM, re-
gardless of abnormalities seen with conventional MRI.36–40
These ﬁndings suggest that brain and spinal cord abnormal-
ities, including not only WM, but also GM, are evident in
NMO. The reason may be because the GM of the brain
and spinal cord shows high AQP4 expression.

The pathological hallmarks of NMO are pattern-speciﬁc
loss of AQP4 immunoreactivity and intense vasculocentric
immune complex depositions with activated comple-
ment.41–43 These ﬁndings in the spinal cord and optic nerves
of the deﬁnite form of NMO are identical in the limited form
of NMO.12 Recently, we revealed that cortical GM lesions
are evident in NMO brains and are distinct from MS
brains.11,44 Neuropathological assessments have demon-
strated neuronal loss in cortical layers II, III and IV, with
nonlytic reaction of AQP4-negative astrocytes in layer I,
massive activation of microglia in layer II, and meningeal in-
ﬂammation in NMO brains.11 Importantly, all NMO cases
show no evidence of cortical GM demyelination or ectopic
B-cell follicle-like structures in the meninges.11,44 These data
indicate that pathological processes consist not only of in-
ﬂammatory demyelinating events characterized by pattern-
speciﬁc loss of AQP4 immunoreactivity in the spinal cord
and optic nerves, but also of cortical neurodegeneration in
NMO brains.11

Irrespective of abnormalities seen with conventional
MRI, examinations using magnetization transfer and diffu-
sion tensor MRI have demonstrated that patients with
NMO show a reduced magnetization transfer ratio and an
increased mean diffusivity of
the normal-appearing
GM.36–38,40 Two voxel-based morphometry studies have
shown regional atrophy in the sensorimotor, visual and
frontotemporal cortices.39,40 These data provide evidence
that GM pathology is present during the disease processes
of NMO. Moreover, consistent with our pathological ﬁnd-
ings indicating that unique cortical GM lesions are evident,
but that cortical GM demyelination is absent,11,44 a previ-
ous paper45 demonstrated that DIR sequences did not de-
tect any cortical GM lesions in NMO brains. 3D-DIR has
poor sensitivity for detecting cortical GM lesions, in partic-
ular, subpial lesions in MS.30,31 Because NMO brains have
unique cortical GM lesions without any cortical demyelin-
ation and more severe damage in the subpial layers than
deep layers,11 cortical GM lesions in NMO may not be de-
tected with DIR sequences.

CONCLUSIONS

The involvement of not only WM, but also GM in the brain
and spinal cord is seen in MS and NMO. However, studies of
GM involvement in MS and NMO have only just begun, and
no direct evidence of clinical relevance for GM involvement,
including cognitive and physical impairment in MS and
NMO, has been reported. As an example of the clinical rel-
evance of GM involvement, common cognitive impair-
ments, including impairment in attention, processing speed,
executive functioning, and memory, are seen in MS46 and
NMO.11 With radiological and clinical assessments, a corre-
lation between cortical atrophy and cognitive decline in pa-
tients with MS47–49 has been observed, and cortical GM
lesions detected with DIR sequences are considered to be
a better predictor of cognitive impairment than WM lesions
in patients with RRMS.49–52 However, 3D-DIR has poor
sensitivity for detecting cortical GM demyelinating lesions
in MS31 and neurodegeneration in cortical GM in NMO,45
because band-like subpial demyelination (Type III lesion)
is the most common type of cortical GM lesions in MS
brains, and NMO brains have unique cortical GM lesions
without cortical demyelination and more severe damage in
the subpial layers than in deep layers.11,44 Full understand-
ing of the relationships among GM lesions, cognitive impair-
ment and disease progression awaits future studies.
