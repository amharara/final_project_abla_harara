Abstract
Background: The family of 14-3-3 proteins plays an important role in the regulation of cell survival and death.
Here, we investigate the role of the 14-3-3 gamma (14-3-3 γ) subunit for glial responses in autoimmune
demyelination.
Methods: Expression of 14-3-3 γ in glial cell culture was investigated by reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) and immunocytochemistry. 14-3-3 γ knockout mice were subjected to murine myelin
oligodendrocyte-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (MOG-EAE), an animal model mimicking
inflammatory features and neurodegenerative aspects of multiple sclerosis (MS).
Results: Expression studies in cell culture confined expression of 14-3-3 γ to both, oligodendrocytes (OL) and
astrocytes. RT-PCR analysis revealed an increased expression of 14-3-3 γ mRNA in the spinal cord during the late
chronic phase of MOG-EAE. At that stage, EAE was more severe in 14-3-3 γ knockout mice as compared to age- and
gender-matched controls. Histopathological analyses on day 56 post immunization (p.i.) revealed significantly enhanced
myelin damage as well as OL injury and secondary, an increase in axonal injury and gliosis in 14-3-3 γ −/− mice. At the
same time, deficiency in 14-3-3 γ protein did not influence the immune response. Further histological studies revealed an
increased susceptibility towards apoptosis in 14-3-3 γ-deficient OL in the inflamed spinal cord.
Conclusion: These data argue for a pivotal role of 14-3-3 γ-mediated signalling pathways for OL protection in
neuroinflammation.

Background
Oligodendrocyte (OL) damage and astrocyte activation
are key features in multiple sclerosis (MS) plaques as
well as in inflamed lesions of rodents suffering from
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an
animal model which mimics many histopathological fea-
tures of MS. To a large extent, inflammatory demyelin-
ation is paralleled by loss of OL in the lesions [31–33].
To date, several factors were identified which govern OL
susceptibility after an inflammatory attack in the CNS.
Such factors comprise neurotrophic cytokines like ciliary
neurotrophic factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, or other
neurotrophic factors [2, 19, 22]. Besides investigations

on glial growth factors, recent studies suggest a role of
oligodendroglial death or pro/anti-apoptotic pathways in
models of demyelination. Among others, candidates include
death pathways involving tumor necrosis factor receptors,
Fas-FasL interaction, or tumour necrosis factor-related
apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) [6, 7, 28, 29]. Yet, some
of these studies reveal divergent roles of some pathways in
toxic vs. autoimmune-mediated demyelination or in vitro
vs. in vivo approaches. Thus, it is still tempting to investi-
gate the role of further molecules implicated in the degen-
eration of CNS cells during autoimmune demyelination.
Here, the family of 14-3-3 proteins may be of particular
interest. In mammals, 14-3-3 proteins comprise seven dis-
tinct highly homologous, ubiquitously expressed isoforms
(γ, β, ζ, η, σ, and τ), which represent about 1 % of the total
soluble brain protein. 14-3-3 subunits are involved in a
wide variety of physiological processes, including neuronal

development, apoptosis, cell cycle control, and signal trans-
duction [42]. The extraordinary large number of more than
100 binding partners for 14-3-3 proteins suggests a role as
major cellular regulator. To date, a plethora of studies de-
scribe a role of 14-3-3 proteins in the pathogenesis of
chronic as well as acute neurodegenerative disorders, in-
cluding Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Alzheimer’s disease,
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or stroke [37]. The function
of 14-3-3 proteins in these conditions comprises several
mechanisms, which may include basic cellular processes
like induction, but also the prevention from apoptotic pro-
cesses depending on the cell type or disease model studied.
To assess the role of 14-3-3 proteins in autoimmune de-
myelination, we employ mice deficient for the 14-3-3
gamma subunit (14-3-3 γ −/− mice). If not challenged,
these mice display a normal anatomy and behavior. Upon
inoculation with pathogenic prion protein, survival rates in
14-3-3 γ −/− mice are unchanged [43]. However, 14-3-3 γ
deficiency may impair
the recruitment of activation-
induced cytidine deaminase to immunoglobulin H switch
regions and is thus involved in class switch DNA recombin-
ation, a mechanism that diversifies the biological antibody
response [50].

Here, we investigate the role of 14-3-3 γ protein in glia
cell culture and in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein
(MOG) peptide 35-55-induced EAE, a model of neuroin-
flammation with neurodegenerative features. Our data
identify a pivotal role of 14-3-3 γ deficiency for OL
apoptosis in neuroinflammation.

Materials and methods
Glial cell culture
Cell culture experiments were performed with primary
murine oligodendroglial precursor cells (OPC) or primary
murine astrocytes which were prepared according to
established protocols with some modifications [13, 25, 41].
OPC were obtained via anti-O4 MACS sorting and cul-
tured on poly-D-lysine-coated coverslips in serum-free
neuro basal medium with addition of NeuroBrew-21
(Miltenyi, Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany).

Animals
14-3-3 γ −/− mice were backcrossed onto a C57BL/6
background for ten times and bred at the in-house animal
care facilities at the University of Ulm, Germany. Control
C57BL/6 mice for EAE experiments were derived from
the same breeding colony. Female mice for animal experi-
mentation were 10–12 weeks old, and body weight was in
a range of 20–25 g. Animals were housed in a room with
controlled light cycle and were given commercial food
pellets and water ad libitum. All animal experiments were
approved by the respective state authorities for animal
experimentation (LANUV, Recklinghausen, Germany).

Induction and clinical evaluation of EAE
For induction of EAE, mice received a s.c. injection at
flanks and tail base of 200 μg MOG 35-55 peptide
(Charité, Berlin, Germany) in PBS emulsified in an equal
volume of CFA containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis
H37RA (Difco, Detroit MI, USA) at a final concentration
of 2 mg/ml. Two injections of pertussis toxin (List via
Quadratech, UK; 200 ng per mouse post immunization
(p.i.)) were given at the time point of immunization and
48 h later. Animals were weighed and scored for clinical
signs of disease on a daily basis. Disease severity was
assessed using a scale ranging from 0 to 10; scores were as
follows [22]: 0 = normal; 1 = reduced tone of tail; 2 = limp
tail, impaired righting; 3 = absent righting; 4 = gait ataxia;
5 = mild paraparesis of hind limbs; 6 = moderate parapar-
esis; 7 = severe paraparesis or paraplegia; 8 = tetraparesis;
9 = moribund; and 10 = death.

Histology
In the chronic phase of the disease (day 56 p.i.), mice
were anesthetized with ketanest and rompun and then
were transcardially perfused with saline followed by 4 %
of paraformaldehyde. The complete spinal cord was
carefully removed, and 8–10 axial sections were further
processed for routine paraffin embedding. Paraffin sec-
tions were subjected to Bielschowsky silver impregna-
tion, Luxol fast blue, or Cresyl Violet staining to assess
parameters of axonal injury, demyelination, or neuronal
damage, respectively.

Immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed with 3 μm paraf-
fin sections as described [21].
If necessary, antigen
unmasking was achieved by heat pre-treatment of sec-
tions for 30 min in 10 mM citric acid buffer (Mac-3,
APP) or 1 mM EDTA (CD3) in a steamer. After inhib-
ition of unspecific binding with 10 % bovine serum
albumin (BSA), sections were incubated overnight at
4 °C with the appropriate primary antibody in 1 % BSA.
Secondary antibodies were used as indicated below.
After blocking of endogenous peroxidase with H2O2, the
peroxidase-based ABC detection system (Vector, Schwal-
bach, Germany) was employed with DAB as the chromo-
genic substrate. Specificity of staining was confirmed by
omitting the primary antibody as a negative control. T
cells were labelled by rat anti-CD3 (Serotec; Wiesbaden,
Germany; 1:200); macrophages by rat anti-mouse Mac-3
(BD Pharmingen, Heidelberg, Germany 1:200); astrocytes
by rabbit anti-mouse glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)
(DAKO, Hamburg, Germany 1:1000); and OL with a
rabbit anti-NogoA antibody (Santa Cruz, Heidelberg,
Germany 1:100) each with appropriate secondary anti-
bodies (1:200, Vector via Linaris, Dossenheim, Germany).
Demyelination was assessed with a mouse anti-mouse

2′,3′-cyclic-nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) anti-
body (SMI91, Sternberger Monoclonals via Covance,
Freiburg, Germany).

Proliferating OPC were stained by double labelling
with rabbit anti-Olig2 (Merck Millipore, Schwalbach,
Germany; 1:500) and mouse anti-Ki-67 (BD Pharmin-
gen, Heidelberg, Germany; 1:100) with Alexa 488 or
Alexa 647 conjugated secondary antibodies, respectively
(Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany). Apoptotic cells were
labelled with a rabbit antibody directed against activated
caspase 3 (Cell Signaling via New England Biolabs,
Frankfurt, Germany; 1:150).

Glial cell cultures were stained via immunocytochem-
istry with a rabbit anti 14-3-3 γ antibody (1:200; kind gift
from Prof. Alistair Aitken, Edinburgh, Scotland) and a
mouse anti-GFAP (1:1000), a rabbit anti-NogoA (1:100),
or a mouse anti-Olig2 antibody (1:200), respectively.

Proliferation assay and ELISA
For spleen-cell recall and proliferation assays, single cell
suspensions of the spleen from MOG 35-55 immunized
14-3-3 γ −/− mice and wild-type C57BL/6 mice were
prepared 10 days after immunization of mice [20]. Cells
(3 × 105) were seeded in 96 well microtiter plates (Nunc,
Wiesbaden, Germany) in 100 μl medium. Antigen con-
centrations were 1, 20, or 100 μg/ml
for MOG and
1.25 μg/ml for ConA. Triplicate cultures were main-
tained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5 %
CO2 for 48 h. Supernatants were harvested after 2 days
of culture. IFN-γ, IL-17, or IL-4 concentrations were de-
termined by sandwich ELISA kits from R&D or BD as
described. For proliferation assays, cells were harvested
following a 16-h pulse with 0.2 μCi/well 3H-dT (triti-
ated thymidine, Amersham-Buchler, Braunschweig,
Germany). Cells were collected on fiberglass filter
paper with a 96-well harvester (Amersham/Pharmacia,
Freiburg, Germany), and radioactivity was measured
with a 96-well Betaplate liquid scintillation counter.

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
protocol
Total RNA from OPC, astrocytes (from cell culture as
described above) or total spinal cord was purified over
RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Reverse
transcription was performed with 12 μl of purified RNA
with Quanti-Tect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen).
RT-PCR for 14-3-3 γ was performed with commercially
available primers (Applied Biosystems) and beta-actin as
internal control. All PCR reactions were performed on a
7500 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) in
quadruplicates; relative quantification was performed ac-
cording to Livak and Schmittgen [24].

Statistical analysis
Quantitative evaluation of histopathological changes
was essentially performed as described earlier [16].
Coded sections were counted by blinded observers by
means of overlaying a stereological grid onto the sec-
tions and counting inflammatory infiltrates per square
millimeter white matter [23]. The extent of demyelin-
ation was assessed semi-quantitatively (Image J, Open
Source) after CNPase staining on an average of four in-
dependent levels of spinal cord per mouse. CD3, Mac-
3, or Olig2/Ki67 double positive cells as well as NogoA,
GFAP, Cresyl Violet, or activated caspase 3 positive
profiles were quantified on three representative sec-
tions, each one of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar
spinal cord by counting two defined areas with the
most intense pathology under a 400-fold magnification.
For quantification of axons in demyelinated white mat-
ter lesions of spinal cord cross sections, silver impreg-
nated profiles were counted on six visual
fields
involving the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal cord
using a grid of 100 μm diameter [16]. Data are pre-
sented as relative axonal densities.

For statistical evaluation of clinical course, data were
pooled from different experiments. Analysis was per-
formed using the Mann-Whitney U test t test as ap-
propriate depending on normal distribution of data
(Prism Graph Pad, La Jolla, USA). All data are given
as mean values ± SEM. p values were considered sig-
nificant at p < 0.05 and highly significant at p < 0.01.

Results
Expression of 14-3-3 γ in EAE and in glial cells
First, we were interested whether 14-3-3 γ is expressed
in EAE. To this end, we compared 14-3-3 γ expression
in naïve spinal cord to inflamed spinal cord at different
time points of EAE (maximum of disease, day 18 or
chronic phase of EAE, day 50 and 78, respectively). RT-
PCR analyses of spinal cord revealed an sevenfold in-
crease of 14-3-3 γ expression in the spinal cord during
EAE, particularly at later time points (* p < 0.05 at day
78 of EAE; Fig. 1a).

Next, we were interested which cells in the spinal cord
may have the capacity for 14-3-3 γ expression. Since the
increase in 14-3-3 γ expression was most pronounced at
later time points of the disease when inflammation has
already significantly declined, we focused our analysis on
glial cells. RT-PCR for expression of 14-3-3 γ was per-
formed in purified astrocytes and O4 sorted OPC. Ex-
pression analyses revealed the presence of 14-3-3 γ in
purified OPC as well as in astrocytes with a significant
increase as compared to naïve spinal cord (Fig. 1b). To
further confine 14-3-3 γ expression to distinct cell types
on the protein level, immunocytochemistry after double
labelling for 14-3-3 γ and GFAP or Olig2 was performed

in glial cell culture. Laser scanning confocal micros-
copy revealed expression of 14-3-3 γ in the cytoplasm
of single astrocytes and OPC while astrocytic pro-
cesses and some other glial cells were clearly 14-3-3 γ
negative (Fig. 1c, d).

Chronic MOG-EAE in 14-3-3 γ knockout mice is more
severe
After having established that 14-3-3 γ protein is regu-
lated in EAE and present in glial cells, we were next in-
terested in its function during demyelination. To this
end, we investigated chronic MOG-EAE in 14-3-3 γ
knockout mice. Unchallenged, these mice do not display
any obvious phenotype and show similar body weights
as compared to age-matched controls.

After induction of MOG-EAE, disease incidence, mor-
tality, and onset of disease were not different between 14-
3-3 γ knockout mice and controls. At the maximum of

disease on day 15 p.i., there were no differences between
both groups and all mice suffered from severe gait ataxia.
Yet, over the following days (16–20 p.i.), 14-3-3 γ knock-
out mice exhibited an increasing motor impairment with
beginning paraparesis while controls already mildly im-
proved. This difference in motor function lasted until the
later chronic disease phase (day 56 p.i.) when 14-3-3 γ
knockout mice still displayed mild paraparesis as com-
pared to controls which showed mild improvement and
only suffered from mild gait ataxia (Fig. 2).

Enhanced tissue damage in 14-3-3 γ-deficient mice suffer-
ing from chronic EAE
To unravel the mechanism behind the more severe EAE
course in 14-3-3 γ knockout mice after the first max-
imum of disease, we performed a histopathological ana-
lysis of spinal cord cross sections in the chronic disease
phase on day 56 p.i. Upon blinded, semiquantitative

Lee et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation  (2015) 12:187

Blinded quantification of axons after silver impregnation
revealed a significant 21.5 % decrease of axonal densities
in lesions of 14-3-3 γ knockout mice (Fig. 3g, h and
Table 1). In contrast, the numbers of neurons in the
spinal cord gray matter were not different between
knockout mice and controls (Table 1).

In summary, histopathology analysis of chronic EAE
reveals enhanced tissue damage in 14-3-3 γ knockout
mice with increased demyelination and gliosis, but re-
duced numbers of OL.

14-3-3 γ deficiency does not alter the immune response
in MOG-EAE
To investigate the mechanism behind the increase tissue
damage in chronic EAE of 14-3-3 γ knockout mice, we per-
formed an immunological analysis. Blinded quantification
of CD3 positive T cells and Mac-3 positive macrophages
and microglia on spinal cord cross sections at day 56 p.i.
showed no differences in immune cell infiltration between
14-3-3 γ knockout mice and controls (Fig. 4a, b). To investi-
gate effects of 14-3-3 γ deficiency on T cell responses in
more detail, we investigated T cell proliferation in lympho-
cyte primary culture and cytokine production in the spleen
cell primary culture after immunization with MOG 35-55.
In a set of experiments with MOG 35-55 as recall antigen
or polyclonal stimulation with ConA, neither T cell prolifer-
ation nor production of the Th1 cytokine interferon gamma,
the Th17 cytokine interleukin-17, or the Th2 cytokine
interleukin-4 was changed in 14-3-3 γ-deficient cultures as
compared to matched wild-type controls (Fig. 4c–f).

In summary, the more severe clinical course and enhanced
tissue damage in 14-3-3 γ −/− mice after immunization with
MOG 35-55 is not governed by an altered T cell response.

14-3-3 γ deficiency leads to enhanced OL apoptosis after
inflammatory challenge
The enhanced oligodendroglial and myelin damage in
chronic EAE of 14-3-3 γ knockout mice in the setting of
an intact immune response points towards glia intrinsic
mechanisms responsible for the increased tissue injury.
Since 14-3-3 proteins are known to be involved in the

is more severe. Clinical course of MOG 35-55-induced EAE in 14-3-3
γ-deficient mice (gray curve) and C57BL/6 control mice (black curve).
Data are pooled from three different experiments (n = 20 vs. 19 mice
per group). Onset of disease is not different between both groups.
After the first maximum of EAE in wild-type mice at day 15 p.i.; 14-3-3
γ mice display a more severe course of disease until day 20 p.i.. This
enhanced disease severity is maintained in the later disease phase until
day 56 p.i., while controls slightly improve over time (*p < 0.05)

analysis of demyelination after Luxol fast blue staining,
the extent of demyelination was significantly increased
in 14-3-3 γ knockout mice by about 40 %. Similar results
were obtained after immunohistochemistry for CNPase
as another myelin marker (Table 1; Fig. 3a, b). In a next
step, we quantified the numbers of activated astrocytes
by immunohistochemistry for GFAP. As compared to
controls, 14-3-3 γ knockout mice displayed a 30 % in-
crease in GFAP positive reactive astrocytes in the white
matter (Fig. 3c, d and Table 1). At the same time, EAE
diseased knockout mice showed a 30 % decrease in
numbers of NogoA positive OL in the spinal cord
(Fig. 3e, f and Table 1). In naïve 14-3-3 γ knockout mice,
the numbers of NogoA positive OL in the spinal cord
were not different as compared to age- and gender-
matched controls (Additional file 1: Figure S1A–C).

Finally, we performed a stereological analysis to quan-
tify axonal densities in demyelinated lesions and dens-
ities of alpha motor neurons in the anterior horn.

oligodendroglial cells, we additionally quantified the num-
bers of OL with pyknotic or fragmented nuclei by mor-
phological criteria after staining for NogoA and Hemalaun
(Fig. 5d, e). Blinded quantification of the spinal cord cross
sections on day 56 of MOG-EAE revealed a 40 % increase
of apoptotic OL in 14-3-3 γ-deficient mice (Fig. 5f) indi-
cating that most of the apoptotic cells at this late time of
EAE are indeed OL.

In contrast, blinded quantification of Olig2/Ki67 double
positive proliferating OPC did not reveal differences be-
tween wild-type controls and 14-3-3 knockout mice, nei-
ther on day 56 of EAE nor between naïve mice of both
genotypes (Additional file 2: Figure S2). In summary, 14-3-
3 γ deficiency in autoimmune demyelination is associated

with increased apoptosis of oligodendroglial cells but no
changes in OPC proliferation.

Discussion
Our study reveals that 14-3-3 γ protein is present in
oligodendroglial cells and that 14-3-3 γ deficiency leads
to more severe chronic EAE with enhanced demyelin-
ation, OL loss, and increased OL apoptosis. Thus, T cell-
mediated neuroinflammation in the setting of 14-3-3 γ
deficiency may lead to increased loss of OL which in
turn results
secondary
axonal damage, and finally a more severe clinical disease
course. These data imply 14-3-3 γ protein as an import-
ant factor for OL survival in autoimmune demyelination.

Our data on the role of a 14-3-3 subunit in OL extend
previous studies on the presence of 14-3-3 proteins in
glial cell and particularly astrocytes during development
[4] as well as in models of in vitro cell stress, stroke, and
also MS lesions [3, 9, 35, 36]. While 14-3-3 subunits and
also 14-3-3 γ has been implicated in survival of neurons
in different neurodegenerative diseases [37], effects on
axonal densities in our model may be rather secondary
due to enhanced demyelination and OL damage. Al-
though MOG-EAE may affect neurons in the spinal cord
[17, 46], neuronal numbers were not significantly differ-
ent between 14-3-3 γ knockout mice and controls thus
further arguing against a primary effect of 14-3-3 γ on
neurons and direct neuronal degeneration in EAE.

Thus, our data add 14-3-3 γ to an array of intracellular
signalling molecules or pathways which have already been
implicated in OL survival and apoptosis during auto-
immune demyelination. Among others, these factors com-
prise PUMA, BAD, Bcl-2, Akt, p53, TNF receptors,
TRAIL, or also IAP family members [9, 12, 14, 15, 28, 34,
39, 40, 49]. Yet, for some of these pathways, divergent data
on their role in cell culture vs. in vivo models exist, which
points to the importance of testing the relevance of such
pathways in different disease models of demyelination.
This may be also of relevance for a putative role of 14-3-3
γ for repair or remyelination after a demyelinating attack.
Since 14-3-3 γ may protect OL from cell death, it may also
facilitate OL repopulation and thus repair either via direct
effects on OPC or indirectly via preservation of oligo-
dendroglial cells in or around demyelinating lesions. Yet,
repair and remyelination is very incomplete in murine
MOG-EAE in C57BL/6 mice [13] and a proper evaluation
of these questions need further studies in other, e.g., toxic
models of demyelination with better remyelination [18].

The detection of 14-3-3 γ protein not only in OL but
also in astrocytes may additionally suggest role of 14-3-3
γ in astrocyte depletion thus indirectly influencing the
extent of demyelination as recently discussed in different
models after astrocyte ablation [38, 45, 47].

The concept of a protective role of 14-3-3 proteins in
oligodendroglial cells may also have consequences for the
assessment of 14-3-3 in CSF as biomarker. Here, an in-
crease of 14-3-3 as a bulk maker for neuronal degener-
ation has been described in several neurodegenerative
diseases and also MS [5, 26, 27, 30, 42, 48]. Yet, lacking
sufficient reproducibility, the value of 14-3-3 in the CSF as
prognostic biomarker in MS remains ambiguous so far
[10]. Our data indicate that at least 14-3-3 γ may rather
indicate primary damage of oligodendroglia and myelin
than injury to neurons or axons in autoimmune demyelin-
ation. Thus, further human studies on correlation of CSF
14-3-3 with clinical or magnetic resonance imaging surro-
gates of myelin damage, e.g., using magnetization transfer
ratio or diffusion tensor imaging may be helpful [11].

Finally, our data do not argue for a pivotal role of 14-3-
3 γ in immune cells during MOG-EAE, although 14-3-3
adaptor protein-dependent functions have been described
in some immune cell-types. In Toll-like receptors path-
ways of the innate immune response, rather 14-3-3 ε and
σ subunits than 14-3-3 γ proteins seem to play a role [1].
In lymphocytes, a role for 14-3-3 proteins has mainly been
described in cells of the B cell lineage. Here, the 14-3-3 γ
and σ subunits were recently shown to play a role in B
cell homeostasis and class switch recombination [44,
50]. However, MOG 35-55 EAE in C57BL/6 mice is a
mainly T cell-mediated model of autoimmunity where
B cells do not play a vital role for mechanisms of tissue
damage [8]. In this study, 14-3-3 γ deficiency did not
impact on T cell function including T cell proliferation,
cytokine production, and T cell infiltration. Thus, 14-3-
3 γ-related immune effects on the neuroinflammation
may not be immediately expected based on all available
data.

Conclusion
In summary, we here identify 14-3-3 γ protein as a pro-
tective factor for OL in autoimmune demyelination. The
characterization of such factors may further improve our
understanding on mechanisms of tissue destruction in
MS and may eventually contribute to new innovative
therapeutic approaches in MS aiming at direct protec-
tion of glial cells and myelin or even tissue repair. In this
context, future studies in other models of demyelination
or with potent small molecule modulators of 14-3-3
pathways are highly warranted.
