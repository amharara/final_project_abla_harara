Purinergic signalling appears to play important roles in neurodegeneration, neuroprotection and neuro-
regeneration. Initially there is a brief summary of the background of purinergic signalling, including
release of purines and pyrimidines from neural and non-neural cells and their ectoenzymatic degradation,
and the current characterisation of P1 (adenosine), and P2X (ion channel) and P2Y (G protein-coupled)
nucleotide receptor subtypes. There is also coverage of the localization and roles of purinoceptors in
the healthy central nervous system. The focus is then on the roles of purinergic signalling in trauma,
ischaemia, stroke and in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's
diseases, as well as multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Neuroprotective mechanisms
involving purinergic signalling are considered and its involvement in neuroregeneration, including the
role of adult neural stem/progenitor cells.

1. Introduction

Purinergic signalling, adenosine 50-triphosphate (ATP) acting
as an extracellular signalling molecule, was proposed in 1972
(Burnstock, 1972). In 1976 the concept was introduced that ATP is a
cotransmitter in most if not all nerves in the peripheral and central
nervous system (CNS) (Burnstock, 1976; see Burnstock, 2014). Two
families of receptors for purines were recognised in 1978, P1 re-
ceptors for adenosine and P2 receptors for ATP and adenosine 50-
diphosphate (ADP) (Burnstock, 1978). In the early 1990s, receptors
for purines and pyrimidines were cloned and characterised (see
Ralevic and Burnstock, 1998). Currently it is established that there

are four subtypes of the adenosine P1 receptor (A1, A2A, A2B, A3),
seven subtypes of the P2X ion channel receptor (P2X1-7) and eight
subtypes of P2Y G protein-coupled receptor (P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, P2Y6,
P2Y11, P2Y12, P2Y13, P2Y14) (see Burnstock, 2007a). Ectoenzymes
that hydrolyse ATP and adenosine released from cells have been
identiﬁed (see Zimmermann, 2000; Yegutkin, 2014) and release of
purines and pyrimidines from nerves and most non-neuronal cell
types in response to mechanical stimulation described (see
Burnstock, 1999; Lazarowski et al., 2011).

The actions of adenosine in the CNS were recognised early (see
Phillis and Wu, 1981; Williams, 1984; Dunwiddie, 1985; Snyder,
1985), while consideration of the role(s) of ATP in the CNS
received more attention later (see Bo and Burnstock, 1994;
Burnstock, 1996, 2003, 2007b; Gibb and Halliday, 1996; Inoue
et al., 1996; Abbracchio, 1997; Illes and Zimmermann, 1999;
Masino and Dunwiddie, 2001; North and Verkhratsky, 2006). In
particular, fast purinergic synaptic transmission has been clearly
identiﬁed in the brain (Edwards et al., 1992; Bardoni et al., 1997;
Nieber et al., 1997; Pankratov et al., 1999, 2002, 2009; Khakh,
2001; Mori et al., 2001; Robertson et al., 2001). Adenosine is the
predominant, presynaptic modulator of transmitter release in the
CNS (see Dunwiddie, 1985). However, ATP can also act presynap-
tically (Cunha and Ribeiro, 2000). Local network behaviours are
regulated by the balance between the effects of ATP, adenosine and
ectonucleotidases on synaptic transmission (Kato et al., 2004;
Matsuoka and Ohkubo, 2004). Adenosine is produced by ectoen-
zymatic breakdown of released ATP, but subpopulations of brain
neurons and/or astrocytes have been claimed to release adenosine
directly (Wall and Dale, 2007).

There are high concentrations of ATP within the brain, about
2 mmol/kg in the cortex to 4 mmol/kg in the putamen and hip-
pocampus (Kogure and Alonso, 1978). Cortex and hippocampus
synaptic membranes exhibit higher activities of NTPDase1 and
NTPDase2 than cerebellum and medulla oblongata. Ecto-50-nucle-
otidase and adenosine deaminase are found in most brain regions
(Kukulski et al., 2004). There is heterogeneous distribution in the
CNS of both P2X receptors (Llewellyn-Smith and Burnstock, 1998;
Loesch and Burnstock, 1998; Kanjhan et al., 1999; Burnstock and
Knight, 2004; Guo et al., 2008) and P2Y receptors (Moore et al.,
2000; Moran-Jimenez and Matute, 2000; Burnstock, 2003; Miras-
Portugal et al., 2007). A recent review discussed the roles of P2X
receptors in the CNS in health and disease (Burnstock, 2015). P2X2,
P2X4 and P2X6 receptors often form heteromultimers. P2X1 re-
ceptors are expressed in some regions of the brain, such as cere-
bellum, while P2X3 receptors are expressed in the brain stem. P2X7
receptors are probably largely presynaptic. The dominant adeno-
sine receptor subtype in the brain is A1, but A2B and A3 receptors
have also been identiﬁed in some regions of the brain (Latini and
Pedata, 2001). Nucleotides can act synergistically with growth
factors to regulate trophic events (Neary et al., 1994; Rathbone
et al., 1999; Burnstock and Verkhratsky, 2010). Some brain stem
neurons appear to control autonomic functions via purinoceptors
(see Burnstock, 2007b).

There is compelling evidence for the role of ATP as a cotrans-
mitter with classical transmitters in the CNS. ATP is coreleased with
acetylcholine from cortical synaptosomes and for a smaller number
ATP is coreleased with noradrenaline (Potter and White, 1980).
There is corelease of ATP with catecholamines from neurons in the
locus coeruleus (Poelchen et al., 2001) and hypothalamus (Buller
et al., 1996; Sperlagh et al., 1998). Corelease of ATP with g-amino
butyric acid (GABA) occurs in dorsal horn and lateral hypothalamic
neurons (Jo and Role, 2002). Corelease of ATP with glutamate in the
hippocampus (Mori et al., 2001) and with dopamine in the CNS
(Krügel et al., 2003) has also been reported.

Multiple P1 and P2 receptor subtypes are expressed by as-
trocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia (see Burnstock and
Knight, 2004; Verkhratsky et al., 2009). ATP mediates both
short-term calcium signalling events and long-term prolifera-
tion, differentiation and death of glia (Cotrina et al., 2000).
Purinergic receptors have also been identiﬁed on adult neural
stem cells (Mishra et al., 2006; Ulrich et al., 2012). Purinergic
signalling is a major means of integrating functional activity
between neurons, glial and vascular cells in the CNS (see
Abbracchio and Burnstock, 1998; Fields and Burnstock, 2006;
Parpura and Zorec, 2010; Matute and Cavaliere, 2011; Verderio
and Matteoli, 2011).

A discussion of the involvement of purinergic signalling in
neurodegeneration, neuroprotection and regeneration has been
included in a number of reviews (Franke and Illes, 2006;
Burnstock, 2007b, 2015; Abbracchio et al., 2009; Burnstock and
Verkhratsky, 2012; Illes et al., 2012; Ulrich et al., 2012; Volonte
and Burnstock, 2012). It is clear that the involvement of puriner-
gic signalling is complex and involves the combined activity
resulting from ATP release, receptor activation and ectonucleotide
enzyme activity.

The involvement of ATP in peripheral (including enteric) nerve
degeneration and regeneration has also been studied (see Tokui
et al., 1994; Sch€afer et al., 1995; Xu et al., 2013; Jung et al., 2014),
but will not be covered in this review article, which is focussed on
the CNS.

2. Trauma, ischaemia and stroke

Trauma, ischaemia and stroke lead to the release of ATP/aden-
osine from cells in the CNS (Neary et al., 1996; Abbracchio and
Burnstock, 1998). These signalling molecules play two roles:
partly to aggravate the neuronal and glial damage caused by
mechanical trauma/metabolic limitation, and partly to serve as
protective mechanisms (see Zimmermann, 1994; Fields and
Stevens-Graham, 2002; Neary et al., 2003; M^eme et al., 2004;
Franke et al., 2006a; Majumder et al., 2007). Pyridoxalphosphate-6-
azophenyl-20,40-disulfonic acid (PPADS), a P2 receptor antagonist,
supports recovery from experimental stroke in vivo (L€ammer et al.,
2011).

ATP release appears to be important in triggering cellular re-
sponses to trauma (see Franke et al., 2006a). Astrocytes sense the
severity of damage in the CNS via ATP release from damaged cells
and they can modulate the tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a)-
mediated inﬂammatory response. Micromolar ATP activation of
P2Y receptors boosts a moderate inﬂammatory response, while
millimolar ATP activation of P2X receptors appears to prevent the
perpetuation of a comparatively large inﬂammatory response.
Astrocytic release of ATP has been demonstrated in vivo to be
essential in mediating the injury-induced defensive responses of
microglial processes (Davalos et al., 2005). Upon traumatic brain
injury, microglial processes rapidly converge on the site of injury
without cell body movement. This chemotactic response can be
mimicked by local injection of ATP and can be inhibited by blockers
of P2Y receptors. Microglial cells orchestrate inﬂammatory brain
responses to trauma and hypoxia. They are activated by purines and
pyrimidines to release the inﬂammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-
1b and IL-6 and TNF-a. Resting microglia, characterised by a com-
plex network of processes, migrate to the site of damage after brain
trauma, where they are transformed into the activated amoeboid
form; ATP has been shown to replicate this transformation (Xiang
et al., 2006).

Cerebellar lesions produce up-regulation of P2X1 and P2X2 re-
ceptors in precerebellar nuclei (Florenzano et al., 2002). Stab
wound injury in the nucleus accumbens led to increase in

expression of subtypes of P2X and P2Y receptors (Franke et al.,
2006a). A signiﬁcant
increase in ecto-NTPDase and ecto-
50nucleotidase activities occurs following cortical stab injury in
rats, whereas in other brain areas only as increase in 50-nucleo-
tidase activity was seen (Nedeljkovic et al., 2006). After stab wound
injury,
receptor-
immunoreactivity was observed on cells labelled for the astro-
cytic marker glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (Franke et al., 2001).
Cortical stab injury induced rapid focal varicose swelling that
developed into beading of NTPDase 3-positive ﬁbres expressing
P2X2 receptors (Bjelobaba et al., 2010). Changes in expression of
ecto-50-nucleotidase have been described in the rat model of
cortical stab injury (Bjelobaba et al., 2011). P2Y1, P2Y2 and P2Y6
receptor-immunoreactivity also became apparent on astrocytes
around the stab wound (Franke et al., 2004b). Reduction of long-
term neurologic injury after blunt spinal trauma is evoked by A2A
receptor agonists (Reece et al., 2004). ATP and nitric oxide (NO) play
key roles in mediating neuronal responses after cell damage.
Nitrergic and purinergic systems are activated after cerebellar
lesion. Colocalisation of P2X1 and P2X2 receptors with neuronal NO
synthase was observed in olivary and pontine neurons (Viscomi
et al., 2004). The inhibitory effects of ATP on NO production
correlate with activation of the transcription factor cyclic AMP
response element-binding protein (Brautigam et al., 2005). After
nerve injury P2X4 receptors induced in spinal microglia gate tactile
allodynia (Tsuda et al., 2003).

P2X7 receptors are activated by ATP released during trauma
and inﬂammation (Le Feuvre et al., 2002). Signalling via P2X7
receptors may allow cells to sense and respond to events occur-
ring in the extracellular environment, modulate the genes
involved in inﬂammatory responses and regulate cytokine re-
sponses in the CNS. P2X7 receptors play a role in mediating spinal
cord injury (Wang et al., 2004). Since P2X7 receptors are highly
expressed in spinal cord neurons, it was concluded that spinal
cord injury is associated with prolonged activation of these re-
ceptors, which results in excitotoxicity-based neuronal degener-
ation. This study supports the role of ATP as an early danger signal
in neurodegenerative damage. ATP-induced stimulation of P2X7
receptors releases not only ATP and glutamate, but also GABA
from astrocytes of the brain (Wang et al., 2002). Thus the hypoxic
release of ATP may exert both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal
modulation via glutamate and GABA, respectively (Wirkner et al.,
2005).

Receptor-positive neurons and glial cells in the rat nucleus
accumbens showed signiﬁcant increase in the number of P2Y1
after injury and coexpression of P2Y1 receptors and vesicular
glutamate transporter
immunopositive cells was observed
(Franke et al., 2006b). The authors concluded that the enhanced
sensitivity of neurons to purinergic signalling in trauma may be
related to changes in glutamatergic transmission. Focal cerebral
ischaemia induced by intraluminal occlusion of the right middle
cerebral artery results in the release of ATP into the rat striatal
microdialysate (Melani et al., 2005). Mechanical injury to the rat
nucleus accumbens elevated the concentrations of both ATP and
glutamate in the microdialysate (Franke et al., 2006b). The local
increase in the ATP concentration may lead to the up-regulation
of the ecto-nucleotidases hydrolysing extracellular ATP (Braun
et al., 1998). ATP together with glutamate may exert an excito-
toxic action, thereby causing the death of previously uninjured
neurons and astrocytes (Dallas et al., 2007). The hypoxia-induced
outﬂow of glutamate may be the consequence of the release of
ATP (Rodrigues et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2006; Sperlagh et al.,
2007).

Mechanical injury to the rat spinal cord caused an immediate,
irreversible loss of tissue at the lesion site, as well as secondary

extensive tissue damage over time (Wang et al., 2004; Peng et al.,
2009). The secondary tissue damage was partially due to the
release of ATP and its mediation by P2X7 receptors.

P2X7 receptors appear to be the main triggers of necrosis/
apoptosis in mechanically or ischaemically damaged CNS cells, but
other P2X receptor subtypes are probably also involved (Franke
and Illes, 2006; Volonte et al., 2003). Unilateral cerebellectomy
axotomized precerebellar neurons, for example, either degen-
erated, or became immunopositive for P2X1 and P2X2 receptors
(Florenzano et al., 2002). Also P2Y1, P2X3 as well as P2X7 re-
ceptors played a detrimental role in neurotransmission in CA1
hippocampus during oxygen and glucose deprivation, causing
downstream activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein
kinase (ERK)1/2 that is involved in cell excitability and death
(Traini et al., 2011). P2 receptor antagonists prevented the syn-
aptic failure.

In cultured oligodendrocytes,

in contrast to astrocytes and
neurons, hypoxia/ischaemia down-regulated P2X7 expression
(Wang et al., 2009).
In healthy animals, P2X7 receptor-
immunoreactivity was absent from microglia, but appeared after
middle cerebral artery occlusion. The P2 receptor antagonist,
reactive blue 2, reduced the ischaemic damage. Further, a P2Y re-
ceptor on microglia directed the convergence of these cells to the
site of traumatic injury, establishing a barrier between the healthy
and injured tissue (Davalos et al., 2005). The expression of P2X7
receptors, accompanying the activation of brain microglia after
mechanical
is an early reaction, followed later by the
appearance of these receptors on glial cells and probably also
neurons (Franke et al., 2007).

injury,

There are changes in the second messenger mechanisms
coupled to P2X and P2Y receptors activated by nucleotides
following brain damage. For P2X receptors, a rapid increase of
intracellular Ca2þ and activation of Ca2þ-dependent enzymatic
pathways is the primary mediator of early and long-term cellular
changes. P2Y receptor subtypes are linked to the protein kinase
signalling pathways regulating cellular proliferation, differentiation
and survival such as ERK and protein kinase (PK) B/Akt (Neary and
Kang, 2005; Neary and Zimmermann, 2009). After trauma, P2 re-
ceptor/protein kinase cascades are activated, induced by mechan-
ical and ischaemic stress, leading to late responses of glial cells,
including proliferation (glial scars) of astroglia and demyelination
in the white matter of oligodendroglia.

PKB/Akt is a signalling molecule that regulates cell survival,
growth and metabolism and inhibits apoptosis. Traumatic brain
injury activates Akt. ATP was released when cortical astrocytes
were subjected to mechanical strain, leading to Akt activation and
PPADS attenuated the Akt activation (Neary et al., 2005). Mechan-
ical strains comparable to those that occur in humans subjected to
traumatic brain injury, cause release of ATP from astrocytes. Then
there is activation of purinergic receptors coupled to protein kinase
cascades that regulate expression of genes involved in long-term,
trophic actions (Neary et al., 2006). The activity of GSK-3, which
is known to be involved in cell proliferation and survival, is regu-
lated by ATP in astrocytes and is likely to be involved in the
response of the brain to injury on release of ATP (Neary and Kang,
2006).

The signiﬁcance of the hypoxia-induced release of ATP in the
ventral medulla oblongata for respiratory control has been dis-
cussed (Rong et al., 2003; Gourine et al., 2005, 2010). There is ev-
idence to support the view that adenosine regulation is a signiﬁcant
factor in the onset and recovery of traumatic brain injury and
therapeutic strategies based on P1 receptor compounds are being
explored (Lusardi, 2009). Hypoxic-ischaemic injury to perinatal
brain is a major contributor to morbidity in children and adenosine
has been claimed to play a role in its pathophysiology (Pimentel

Fig. 1. Resolution of inﬂammation and tissue repair. Clearing of dead cells and suppression of inﬂammation are key events in brain repair. Find-me signals (UTP, ATP) attract
microglia and macrophages through P2Y2 receptors. Eat-me signals include UDP, which acts on P2Y6 receptors to stimulate microglial phagocytosis, and phosphatidylserine
(PtdSer), which is translocated to the outer leaﬂet of the plasma membrane of apoptotic cells. PtdSer-binding proteins involved in the clearance of dead cells include milk fat globule
epidermal growth factor 8 protein on microglia and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing molecule 4 (TIM4) on macrophages. Immunoglobulins directed against
CNS antigens, which appear after stroke, may also promote phagocytosis by engaging Fc receptors on phagocytic cells. Phagocytosis promotes secretion of IL-10 and TGF-b, which, in
turn, suppress antigen presentation, promote Treg formation, inhibit expression of adhesion molecules in endothelial cells and production of proinﬂammatory cytokines. TGF-b and
IL-10 are also neuroprotective and may facilitate brain repair processes. In addition, lipoxins, resolvins and protectins, metabolites of arachidonic acid and omega-3 fatty acids that
play an active part in the resolution of inﬂammation in other organs, could also contribute to suppress postischemic inﬂammation. Growth factors and MMPs produced by
endothelial cells, neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia are key molecules driving tissue reorganization and repair.

et al., 2015). The authors highlighted the potential role played by
adenosine deaminase inhibitors to increase adenosine at the sites
of injury.

Inﬂammation and immunity are major elements in the patho-
biology of stroke. ATP released during ischaemic damage activated
P2X7 receptors on microglia leading to release of proinﬂammatory
cytokines and activated microglia migrate and exhibit macrophage-
like activity via P2Y6 receptors (see Iadecola and Anrather, 2011;
Fig. 1). Recent reviews that discuss purinergic signalling and
inﬂammation are available (Eltzschig et al., 2012; Fiebich et al., 2014;
Idzko et al., 2014; Morandini et al., 2014). Ischaemic pathologies
of white matter include a high proportion of stroke lesions (Fern
et al., 2014).

3. Neurodegenerative diseases

Neurodegeneration is the basis of the wide range of neurode-
generative diseases, involving both neurons and glial cells and
there is increasing evidence for the participation of purinergic
signalling (see Burnstock, 2008; Burnstock and Verkhratsky, 2012).
Microglia play an important role against infection in the CNS, but
overstimulation of this immune reaction may accelerate the
neuronal damage caused by neurodegenerative diseases and hu-
man immunodeﬁciency virus encephalopathy, which exhibit
microglial proliferation and activation (Ogata et al., 2003). ATP in-
hibits cytokine release from lipopolysaccharide-activated microglia
via P2Y receptors and it was suggested that P2Y agonists may be a
potential treatment for toxic immunoreactions.

3.1. Alzheimer's disease (AD)

There is evidence for the involvement of both P1 and P2 re-
ceptors in AD. ATP release during neuronal excitation or injury
enhances the inﬂammatory effects of cytokines and prostaglandin

E2 in astrocytes and contributes to the chronic inﬂammation seen in
AD (Xu et al., 2003). Human brain tissue from patients who died
with a conﬁrmed diagnosis of AD consistently showed a loss of A1
receptors, especially most clearly in the outer layers of dentate
gyrus in hippocampus, the region of the brain most intimately
involved in the processes of learning and memory (Jansen et al.,
1990; Ulas et al., 1993). The levels of A1 and A2A receptors, how-
ever, increased in the frontal cortex, in parallel with an increased
function of these receptors (Albasanz et al., 2008). In AD, a key role
is played by abnormal metabolism of the amyloid precursor protein
(APP), which is cleaved by b- and g-secretases to generate the b-
amyloid (Ab) peptides, present in large amounts in the amyloid
plaques of AD patients' brains. In post-mortem neocortical and
hippocampal tissue from patients with AD, colocalization of A1
receptors with Ab in senile plaques was reported (Angulo et al.,
2003). It was shown that, in human neuroblastoma cells, activa-
tion of A1 receptors activated PKC, p21 Ras and ERK1/2, leading to
increased formation of soluble Ab fragments. These ﬁndings would
implicate A1 receptors in Ab metabolism and suggest that agonists
at these receptors might be useful drugs for the treatment of
established or late-stage AD (see Stone et al., 2009).

There is evidence implicating P2 receptors, in particular P2X7, in
AD. In an early study, primary rat microglia stimulated with either
ATP or 20- and 30-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP (BzATP) were shown
to release copious amounts of superoxide primarily via the
increased expression of P2X7 receptors (Parvathenani et al., 2003).
ATP and BzATP also stimulated microglia-induced cortical cell
death suggesting that
to neuro-
degeneration. P2X7 receptors were shown to be up-regulated
around Ab plaques
in a mouse model of AD (Tg2576)
(Parvathenani et al., 2003). Enhanced expression of P2X7 receptors
in brain samples from six AD patients was reported (McLarnon
et al., 2006). Prominent P2X7 receptor expression was observed
in association with Ab plaques on microglia. Cultured foetal human

microglia cells exposed to amyloidogenic Ab1-42 peptide had
signiﬁcantly elevated levels of P2X7 receptors compared with un-
treated cells. Ab triggers increases in intracellular Ca2þ concentra-
tions, ATP release,
IL-1b secretion and plasma membrane
permeabilization in microglia from wild type (WT) but not from
P2X7 knockout (KO) mice (Sanz et al., 2009). Similarly, intra-
hippocampal injection of Ab caused a large accumulation of IL-1
in WT but not in P2X7 KO mice. This suggests that Ab activates
a purinergic autocrine/paracrine stimulatory loop involving P2X7
receptors.
In the APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse model of AD, P2X7
immunoreactivity was predominantly found in activated microglia
before Ab plaque formation, suggesting a causative role in
disease onset. Further, during disease development, upregulation
of P2X7 and reactive oxygen species production in microglia par-
allelled Ab increase and was associated with synaptotoxicity (Lee
et al., 2011). Thus, P2X7 receptors mediate microglial purinergic
inﬂammatory responses in AD brain. ATP reduces Ab protein mis-
folding in vitro (Coskuner and Murray, 2014). Activation of P2X7
receptor-stimulated release of sAPPa from mouse and human
neuroblastoma cells and from mouse primary astrocytes and neural
progenitor cells was inhibited by P2X7 antagonists or by P2X7 re-
ceptor knockdown with siRNAs. This was not observed in neural
cells from P2X7 KO mice. Other P2X receptor subtypes have been
implicated in AD. Ab1-42 promoted accumulation of P2X4 receptors
in neurons and induced caspase-3-mediated cleavage of the re-
ceptor that slowed channel closure times and prevented agonist-
induced receptor internalization (Varma et al., 2009). Reduced
expression of P2X4 receptors in primary rodent neurons attenuated
Ab1-42-induced neuronal death. In contrast, induced P2X4 expres-
sion in a neuronal cell line that does not normally express P2 re-
ceptors enhanced the toxic effect of Ab1-42.

In AD brains, P2Y1 receptors were localized to neuroﬁbrillary
tangles, neuritic plaques and neuropil threads (Moore et al., 2000).
Activation of the P2Y2 receptor expressed in human 1321N1 as-
trocytoma cells enhanced the release of sAPPa in a time- and
dose-dependent manner (Camden et al., 2005). P2Y2 receptor-
activated sAPPa release was partially suppressed by ADAM10 or
ADAM17/TACE, while treatment of cells with both ADAM10 and
ADAM17/TACE siRNA completely abolished uridine 50-triphos-
phate-activated sAPPa release. APP expression and release from
astrocytes are regulated by nucleotides through activation of P2Y2/
4 receptors (Tran, 2011). The ATP synthase b subunit was identiﬁed
as a new autoantigen in AD (Vacirca et al., 2011, 2012). A recent
review presents evidence that there is a prominent role for P2Y
receptors in AD pathology, including Ab production and elimina-
tion, neuroinﬂammation, neuronal function and cerebral blood
ﬂow (Erb et al., 2015). Serum anti-ATP synthase autoantibodies
were observed in 38% of patients with AD, but not in healthy
subjects or in patients with Parkinson's or atherosclerosis. ATP
synthase autoantibodies have been proposed as potential serum
biomarkers for AD.

3.2. Parkinson's disease (PD)

The motor symptoms of PD are due to the degeneration of the
dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway. A2A receptors
have been implicated in the pathophysiology of PD, due to its
extensive interaction with the dopaminergic system in extrapyra-
midal areas (Morelli et al., 2010). An early event in PD is increased
striatal A2A receptor expression (Villar-Menendez et al., 2014) and
A2A receptor antagonists are being explored for the treatment of PD
(Antonini and Poewe, 2014; Gyoneva et al., 2014; Perez-Lloret and
Merello, 2014; Zheng et al., 2014). Readers are referred to a number
of authoritative reviews about the role of A2A receptors in PD (Azam
et al., 2009; Pinna, 2009; Jenner et al., 2009; Ciruela et al., 2011;

Burnstock and Verkhratsky, 2012) that also draw our attention to
the possible involvement of other purinergic receptors.

Data has implicated the P2X7 receptor in PD (Jun and Kin, 2004;
Marcellino et al., 2010). Nigral P2X7 immunoreactivity was mainly
found in microglia but also in astroglia in the unilateral 6-
hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rat model of PD. The P2X7 antago-
nist 3-[[5-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-1H-tetrazol-1-yl]methyl]pyridine
(A-438079) signiﬁcantly reduced the 6-OHDA-induced depletion
of striatal dopamine stores. In conclusion, in addition to A2A re-
ceptors, other purinergic receptors, in particular the P2X7 receptor,
may be involved in PD. However, lack of neuroprotection for the
survival of dopaminergic neurons in P2X7 receptor-deﬁciency or
inhibition in toxin-induced animal models of PD was reported
(Hracsko et al., 2011).

Transplanting foetal nigral grafts containing dopaminergic
neurons into the brain of Parkinson's patients has had limited
success (Braak and Del Tredici, 2008). Transplanting enteric
nerves (containing dopaminergic nerves) may be a promising
alternative (Tew et al., 1992). Nucleotides affect neurogenesis and
have the potential to produce dopaminergic neurons from neural
progenitor cells derived from foetal mouse midbrain (Delic and
Zimmermann, 2010).

3.3. Huntington's disease (HD)

HD is an inherited motor disorder, characterized by progressive
striatal neurodegeneration. The mutation responsible for this dis-
ease is an abnormally expanded and unstable CAG repeat within
the coding region of the gene encoding the huntingtin protein.
GABAergic enkephalin neurons of the basal ganglia are the most
vulnerable cells in HD. They show the highest levels of expression
of adenosine A2A receptors. This selective neuronal vulnerability
occurs despite ubiquitous expression of mutant and normal hun-
tingtin suggests that these receptors might play a pathogenetic role
in HD (Popoli et al., 2007, 2008). Changes in A2A receptor expression
and signalling in both experimental models of HD (Tarditi et al.,
2006) and in peripheral blood circulating cells of HD patients
(Varani et al., 2001, 2007) support this hypothesis. However, the
functional signiﬁcance of the aberrant A2A receptor phenotype in
HD is complicated by conﬂicting data about the potential neuro-
protective and neurodegenerative effects of these receptors in the
brain. In experimental models of HD, both A2A receptor agonists
and antagonists have shown beneﬁcial effects (Popoli et al., 2008).
A2A receptor KO mice showed signiﬁcantly worse motor perfor-
mances and survival (Mievis et al., 2011).

The P2X7 receptor also appears to be involved in HD. Increased
P2X7 receptor levels and altered P2X7 mediated calcium perme-
ability in somata and terminals of HD neurons were shown using
transgenic mice HD models (Díaz-Hernandez et al., 2009). Also,
cultured neurons
expressing mutant huntingtin exhibited
increased susceptibility to apoptosis triggered by P2X7 receptor
stimulation. Administration in vivo of Brilliant Blue G (BBG), a P2X7
antagonist, to HD mice prevented neuronal apoptosis and attenu-
ated body weight loss and motor-coordination deﬁcits.

3.4. Multiple sclerosis (MS)

Both P2X7 and P2Y receptors have been shown to be involved in
MS. Nucleotides, which are released in high amounts under in-
ﬂammatory conditions and following cell death, may regulate
remyelination processes in demyelinating diseases. Different types
of P2 receptors expressed by oligodendrocyte progenitor cells
(OPs), cells that give rise to mature myelinating oligodendrocytes,
were described (Agresti et al., 2005b). Nucleotide-induced Ca2þ
raises in these cells are mainly due to the activation of P2X7 and

P2Y1 receptors. ATP and ADP stimulated migration but inhibited the
mitogenic response of OPs to platelet derived growth factor.
Decreased levels of P2Y12 receptors were observed in proximity to
demyelinating lesions in sections of cerebral cortex from post-
mortem MS brains (Amadio et al., 2010). This was correlated with
the extent of demyelination found in grey matter cortical plaques
and subcortical white matter.

There was a marked increase of P2X7 immunoreactivity in
reactive astrocytes of autopsy brain tissues from MS patients
(Narcisse et al., 2005). In human MS specimens, the density of P2X7
receptors on microglial cells was signiﬁcantly increased in affected
regions. P2X7 receptor blockade prevented ATP excitotoxicity in
oligodendrocytes, reduced demyelination and ameliorated neuro-
logical symptoms in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
(EAE), a model of MS (Matute et al., 2007). Moreover, development
of this model was suppressed in P2X7 KO mice (Sharp et al., 2008).
In brain homogenates of EAE rats there was increased levels of
P2X7 receptor protein (Grygorowicz et al., 2011). In another study,
patients with relapsing-remitting MS showed strikingly reduced
numbers of blood regulatory T (Treg) cells expressing CD39. Acti-
vated Treg cells are able to abrogate ATP-related effects, which is
consistent with the hypothesis that there is an increase in P2X7
receptor-mediated cell cytotoxicity in MS (Borsellino et al., 2007).
However, P2X7 receptor KO mice were shown to develop more
severe clinical and pathological expression of EAE than WT controls
(Chen and Brosnan, 2006).

GPR17, a P2Y-like receptor, was shown to be involved in repair of
demyelinating wounds in two distinct stages of early slowly
proliferating OPs that are present in the parenchyma of the adult
brain (Lecca et al., 2008). Mature oligodendrocytes no longer
expressed GPR17, suggesting that the receptor has to be down-
regulated to allow cells to proceed to terminal differentiation.
Activation of GPR17 by uridine 50-diphosphate (UDP) or UDP-
glucose caused progression of immature OPs towards mature
myelinating oligodendrocytes (Ceruti et al., 2011; Fumagalli et al.,
2011). GPR17 inhibition or knockdown by siRNAs impaired the
normal differentiation of OPs (Fumagalli et al., 2011). Lymphocytes
from MS patients upregulate A2A receptors that mediate anti-
inﬂammatory actions (Vincenzi et al., 2013).

3.5. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)

The involvement of purinergic signalling in ALS, in particular
P2X4 and P2X7 receptor subtypes, has been proposed. The density
of P2X7 microglial cells/macrophages was signiﬁcantly increased in
human ALS specimens (Yiangou et al., 2006). Up-regulation of
P2X4, P2X7 and P2Y6 receptors and down-regulation of ATP-
hydrolysing activities was reported in microglia from transgenic
mice over-expressing human superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), an
animal model of ALS (D'Ambrosi et al., 2009). In SOD1 astrocyte
cultures, repeated stimulation by ATP or BzATP caused astrocytes to
become neurotoxic, inducing death of motor neurons and P2X7
receptor involvement was supported by BBG inhibition of the ATP
and BzATP effects (Gandelman et al., 2010).
Increased ATP-
dependent proliferation and a basal increase in extracellular ATP
degradation was also seen in SOD1 astrocytes. Thus purinergic
activation of both astrocytes and microglia in ALS may constitute a
route involved in disease progression.

High P2X4 receptor expression was shown to be selectively
localised on degenerating motoneurons in the ventral horn of the
spinal cord in a transgenic rodent model of ALS, the SOD1G93A
(Casanovas et al., 2008). P2X4 receptors were also seen on degen-
erating neurons in the locus coeruleus, reticular formation and
Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. P2X4 receptor antibodies cross-
react with misfolded forms of mutant SOD1 that is present in

neurons, but not in glial cells (Hernandez et al., 2010). It was
concluded that neuronal SOD1G93A conformers with P2X4 receptor
immunoreactivity may have pathogenic relevance in the promotion
of neuroinﬂammation.

It has been claimed that the death of motoneurons in ALS can be
reduced by adenosine A2A receptor antagonists (Mojsilovic-
Petrovic et al., 2006). It was concluded in a review that purinergic
signalling plays complex roles in ALS, a multifactorial and multi-
systemic disease involving participation of microglia, astrocytes,
muscle and T cells, as well as neurons in different places (Amadio
et al., 2011).

P2X7 receptor activation increases the pro-inﬂammatory ac-
tions of microglia in the SOD1G93A mouse model of ALS and in P2X7
KO mice where there is increased gliosis and motoneuron death
(Apolloni et al., 2013). However, spinal cord injury is reduced by
P2X7 receptor antagonists in the SOD1-mutant mouse model
(Apolloni et al., 2014). A comparison was made of microRNAs
transcriptional proﬁling of non-transgenic and ALS microglia in
resting conditions and after inﬂammatory activation by a P2X7
receptor agonist (Parisi et al., 2013).

4. Neuroprotection

Protection against neural damage caused by trauma, ischaemia,
stroke and neurodegenerative diseases is the focus of many current
investigations. Reviews have been published concerned with the
roles in neuroprotection of adenosine (Stone, 2005; Chen et al.,
2007; Ribeiro, 2008; Williams-Karnesky and Stenzel-Poore, 2009;
Gomes et al., 2011) and of ATP (Skaper, 2007, 2011; Peterson et al.,
2010; Burnstock et al., 2011; Burnstock and Verkhratsky, 2012;
Watts et al., 2013; Corps et al., 2015). In the Editorial about the
Hot Topic Issue of CNS & Neurological Disorders-Drug Targets
entitled ‘Pharmacology and Therapeutic Activity of Purinergic
Drugs for Disorders of the Nervous System’, attention is drawn to
the variety of drugs acting on P2X and P2Y receptor subtypes being
explored for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (Volonte
and Burnstock, 2012).

ATP, released during trauma, acts via P2 receptors to inhibit the
release of the cytotoxic excitatory transmitter, glutamate, and
stimulates release of the inhibitory transmitter, GABA, from hip-
pocampal nerves, thus serving a protective role (Inoue, 1998).
Excessive activation of glutamate receptor systems is implicated in
neuronal cell death associated with stroke and neurodegenerative
diseases such as AD, PD, HD and ALS (Zona et al., 2000). Guanine
nucleotides inhibit N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)- and kainate-
induced neurotoxicity and may be used to antagonise glutamate
receptor-mediated neurotoxicity (Morciano et al., 2004). The P1
receptor antagonist, caffeine, is claimed to have beneﬁcial actions in
both AD and PD (Ribeiro et al., 2003). P2 receptors have been
claimed to mediate neuroprotective effects in the cerebellum,
suggesting the use of P2 receptor agonists as neuroprotective
agents (Volonte et al., 2003). It has been suggested that adenine is
involved in the control of Purkinje cell survival (Watanabe et al.,
2003).

4.1. Neuroprotection against trauma, ischaemia and stroke

The release of adenosine is considered to be a neuroprotective
factor during traumatic and hypoxic/ischaemic CNS injury (Nieber
et al., 1999; Sebasti~ao and Ribeiro, 2009; Stone et al., 2009). Both
neuronal morphology and behavioural tests revealed full preser-
vation of spatial memory and learning ability. In vivo studies indi-
cated a beneﬁcial effect of A1 receptor stimulation in cerebral
ischaemia, but the therapeutic value was limited by the wide

receptor-distribution on neuronal and non-neuronal cells in the
CNS (Stone et al., 2009).

The protective effect of A2A receptor agonists in ischaemia may
be largely due to reduced glutamate outﬂow, particularly from
glial cells (Popoli et al., 1995, 2003; Pedata et al., 2007). Decreased
activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases that are involved
in neuronal death may also contribute to neuroprotection by A2A
antagonism (Kawasaki et al., 1997). A2A receptors trigger the ac-
tions of neurotrophic factors involved in axonal outgrowth or
synaptic plasticity (Sebasti~ao and Ribeiro, 2009), so blockade of
A2A receptors may reduce the effects of neurotropic factors,
favouring neuronal survival and regeneration. In neurodegener-
ative disorders astrocyte death may occur and complicate the
outcome of brain ischaemia. A2A receptor antagonists SCH 58261
(Monopoli et al., 1998) and 8-(3-chlorostyryl)caffeine (Von Lubitz
et al., 1995) were protective in global or focal cerebral ischaemia
in both rats and gerbils (Pedata et al., 2005). Also cerebral
infarction was signiﬁcantly attenuated in A2A receptor KO mice
(Chen et al., 1999). A2A receptor antagonists were also beneﬁcial
for rabbit spinal cord reperfusion injury (Cassada et al., 2001). The
A3 receptor agonist chloro-N6-(3-iodo-benzyl)-adenosine-50-N-
methyluronamide decreased experimentally-induced cerebral
infarction in gerbils and rats (Chen et al., 2006; Von Lubitz et al.,
1994). The protective role of A1 adenosine receptors in hypoxia/
ischaemia in vitro in brain slice preparations was also reported
(e.g. Fujiwara et al., 1987; Nieber et al., 1995; Krnjevic, 1999).

Potential beneﬁts of P2X7 receptor antagonism in rodent
studies of brain and spinal cord injury and neurodegenerative
diseases have been described (Wang et al., 2004; Bartlett et al.,
2014; Sperlagh and Illes, 2014). This has prompted the use of
drugs targeting the P2X7 receptor for the treatment of human
CNS disorders. However, these studies are facing problems, partly
due to the many polymorphic variations of the human P2X7 re-
ceptor. Microglial cells possess P2X7 receptors which become
activated in a rat model of focal cerebral ischaemia to participate in
the early defence reaction (Melani et al., 2006). P2X7 receptor
antagonists adenosine 50-triphosphate-20,30-dialdehyde (oxidized
ATP) or BBG even 15 min after spinal cord injury resulted in
recovery of hind limb motor function (Peng et al., 2009). In the
cerebral cortex of spontaneously hypertensive rats, there was up-
regulation of P2X7 receptor immunoreactivity in the penumbra
surrounding the necrotic region (Franke et al., 2004a). In ATP-
induced secondary damage, via stimulation of P2X (probably
P2X7) receptors in the penumbra, both suramin and PPADS
reduced the infarct volume and accelerated functional recovery
in behavioural tests (Kharlamov et al., 2002; L€ammer et al., 2006,
2011). P2X7 receptor-activated microglia protect neurons against
glutamate toxicity (Suzuki et al., 2004). PPADS, a P2 receptor
antagonist, confers neuroprotection against glutamate/NMDA
toxicity (Lin et al., 2005). It has been claimed that P2X7 receptor
antagonists are neuroprotective for their ability to inhibit assem-
bly of inﬂammasome in glial cells (Murphy et al., 2012). Cerebral
ischaemia-reperfusion injury is a primary cause of ischaemic
stroke and ischaemic postconditioning is considered as an
important technique to contain ischaemia-reperfusion injury,
which involves the activation of P2X7 receptors (Bindra et al.,
2014). Cortical spreading depression is a model of precondition-
ing that provides tolerance to a subsequent ischaemic event in the
brain. It appears to be due to release of ATP via connexin-36
hemichannels into the extracellular space (Schock et al., 2008).
The ATP, via activation of P2Y receptors and new protein synthesis,
causes ischaemic tolerance and enhances neuronal survival in
cultured primary cortical neurons.

P2Y receptor antagonists are potential neuroprotective agents
in the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum by modulation of

kainate- and a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
acid-induced currents. Inhibition of apoptosis by P2Y2 receptor
activation has been claimed to be a novel pathway for neuronal
survival (Arthur et al., 2006). P2Y1 receptor antagonists improve
recovery from traumatic brain injury (Choo et al., 2013). A recent
paper reports that neuroprotection against genotoxic stress is
elicited by P2Y13 receptor activation (Morente et al., 2014). The
P2Y-like receptor, GPR17, is a sensor of brain damage and reacts
to the release of nucleotides and cysteinyl leukotrienes in a focal
ischaemia model (Lecca et al., 2008). It is expressed on OPs, but
not astrocytes, and is a potential target for stroke and spinal cord
injury induced by acute compression (Ceruti et al., 2009). The
in vivo knock-down of GPR17 by an antisense oligonucleotide
strategy markedly reduced tissue damage. It has been claimed that
P2Y2 receptors activate neuroprotective mechanisms in astrocytes
(Chorna et al., 2004).

ATP-MgCl2 decreases lipid peroxidation in spinal cord injury and
protect the spinal cord from secondary injury after trauma. It was
concluded that ATP-MgCl2 should be explored for the treatment of
spinal cord injuries in conjunction with other treatments (Cakir
et al., 2003). After spinal cord injury, topical application of ATP
signiﬁcantly improved locomotor function (Shields et al., 2004).

4.2. Neuroprotection against neurodegenerative diseases

Data from animal models of AD and in samples from AD pa-
tients, support the concept that Ab1-42-induced synaptic dysfunc-
tion and neuronal death may involve abnormalities in purinergic
receptor signalling, with the most convincing evidence for P2X7
receptors (see Takenouchi et al., 2010). Processing of APP is regu-
lated by two different nucleotide receptors, P2X7 and P2Y2, with
opposite effects on a-secretase activity (Leon-Otegui et al., 2011). It
was suggested that activators of the P2Y2 receptor in combination
with P2X7 receptor antagonists could have beneﬁcial effects by
reducing amyloid plaques (Wurtman et al., 2009). Block of P2X7
receptor-mediated activity with BBG was shown to be neuro-
protective in an animal model of AD (Ryu and McLarnon, 2008).
Activation of microglia by Ab requires P2X7 receptor expression
and it was suggested that Ab microglia stimulation may open new
avenues for the treatment of AD (Sanz et al., 2009). ATP, released
from astrocytes, protects Ab-induced impairment of synaptic
plasticity (Jung et al., 2012). P2X7 may also have beneﬁcial effects
via the stimulation of non-amyloidogenic processing of APP by a-
secretases, leading to proteolytic cleavage within the Ab peptide
sequence and shedding of the soluble APP ectodomain (sAPPa),
exerting neuroprotection (Delarasse et al., 2011).

Antagonists of the A2A receptor alleviate symptoms in PD pa-
tients. Ongoing research programs in this area, and orally efﬁca-
cious A2A receptor antagonists, have been advanced into clinical
development (see Shah and Hodgson, 2010). Several xanthines and
non-xanthine compounds possessing good afﬁnity have been
introduced. BIIB014, preladenant and ST-1535 are new adenosine
A2A receptor antagonists currently in use. A2A antagonists may also
be neuroprotective under certain toxicity paradigms (see Stone
et al., 2009). There are Phase I and II clinical trials for evaluation
of their efﬁcacy in PD patients (Pinna, 2009). All these compounds
were safe and well tolerated. Results from the Phase II trial showed
that BIIB014 and preladenant were effective in reducing the waking
time spent in OFF state in patients at the late stage of PD treated
with L-DOPA. BIIB014 was also effective as monotherapy in patients
at the early stage of PD and ST-1535 displays a promising potential
in experimental models of PD and in clinical studies. The thera-
peutic effects of A2A receptor antagonists appear to act via a
reduction of the inhibitory output of the basal ganglia indirect
pathway. This possibility has been validated in patients treated

with the A2A antagonist SYN115 (Black et al., 2010). Neuroprotective
mechanisms also include blockade of A2A receptor-mediated
glutamate release from neurons, inhibition of microglia-induced
inﬂammation. However, there is conﬂicting data on the protective
and detrimental roles reported for A2A receptors in the CNS. Dia-
denosine tetraphosphate (AP4A), an endogenous diadenosine pol-
yphosphate, also has protective effects in the unilateral 6-OHDA
rodent model of PD (Wang et al., 2003). AP4A also reduced TUNEL in
the lesioned nigra 2 days after 6-OHDA administration, implying
inhibition of apoptosis.

Therapeutic potential of P2X7 receptor antagonists for the
treatment of HD was discussed (Díaz-Hernandez et al., 2009).
Decrease in stimulated A1 and A2A receptors has also been
implicated in HD (Bauer et al., 2005; Popoli et al., 2007). Alter-
ations of P2X7 receptor activity could contribute to HD patho-
genesis and highlight the therapeutic potential of P2X7 receptor
antagonists. A2A receptor agonists protect neurons derived from
induced pluripotent stem cells of patients with HD (Chern et al.,
2014). The level of 50-nucleotidase increased in synaptosomes
from the cerebral cortex of rats that were experimentally
demyelinated (Spanevello et al., 2006).

An early feature of MS and its animal model of EAE is neuronal
pathology. Lesional accumulation of P2X receptors on macrophages
in rat CNS in the EAE model has been reported (Guo and
Schluesener, 2005). P2X7 expression is elevated in axon tracts in
patients with MS and ATP can kill oligodendrocytes by activating
P2X7 receptors (Domercq et al., 2010). Patients exhibiting the
remitting/relapsing form of MS have strikingly reduced numbers of
NTPDase1-positive Treg cells, suggesting that purines might be
involved (Borsellino et al., 2007). A regulatory role of P2Y1 receptor
signalling in OPs has been described (Agresti et al., 2005a). It was
suggested that high ATP released in inﬂammatory conditions might
act on P2Y1 receptors to inﬂuence the remyelination processes in
MS. In the lesioned cerebral cortex of MS patients P2Y12 receptor
expression has also been identiﬁed (Amadio et al., 2010). GPR17 is a
key regulator of OP differentiation. GPR17 dysfunctions seem be
present in MS, setting the background for future GPR17-based
remyelination therapies (Chen et al., 2009).

The protective effect mediated by both ATP and ivermectin for
ALS is by potentiation of ATP action on P2X4 receptors (Andries
et al., 2007). Preincubation of motor neurons with a low concen-
tration of ATP protected cells against excitotoxic stimulation, while
high concentrations of ATP were toxic. To study the relevance of
these ﬁndings for ALS, SOD1G93A-mice were treated with iver-
mectin. This led to an increase of the life span of these mice by
almost 10%. The increased expression of P2X1 receptors on axo-
tomized facial motoneurons was impaired in SOD1G93A-mutant
mice (Kassa et al., 2007). It was suggested that the release of ATP
from mutant motor neurons is altered after damage.

5. Neuroregeneration: neural stem/progenitor cells

A major obstacle for neural repair is the weak regenerative
capacity of injured neurons, although the neonatal brain has a
greater capacity for recovery than the adult brain (Pekovic et al.,
2006). There are a number of reports about the role of puriner-
gic drugs promoting regeneration of injured and degenerating
nerves in the brain and spinal cord. Both A1 and A2 receptors
mediate proliferation of microglia (Gebicke-Haerter et al., 1996).
Inosine has been shown to stimulate axonal growth in the rat
corticospinal tract after injury (Benowitz et al., 1999, 2001). Acti-
vation of purinergic signalling in astrocytes via P2Y4 receptors
induced by trauma stimulates the synthesis and release of
thrombospondin-1, an extracellular matrix molecule that induces

synapse formation during development and may play a role in CNS
repair and remodelling after injury (Tran and Neary, 2006).

ATP and its analogues are involved in tissue remodelling in
response to injury and have a key role in regulation of repair and
regeneration (Burnstock and Verkhratsky, 2010). Stimulation of
purinoceptors in the CNS triggers astrogliosis, the response of
astrocytes to brain damage, which is characterised by cell prolif-
eration and remodelling of the neural circuitry (Giaume et al.,
2007). In combination with growth factors such as ﬁbroblast
growth factor, epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived
growth factor, ATP can stimulate astrocyte proliferation, contrib-
uting to the process of reactive astrogliosis (Abbracchio and
Burnstock, 1998; Ishibashi et al., 2006; Neary et al., 2006). P2Y
receptors are claimed to mediate reactive astrogliosis via induc-
tion of cyclo-oxygenase-2, and P2Y receptor antagonists reduce
astrogliosis (Brambilla et al., 1999). Reactive astrogliosis is
instrumental for limitation of brain damaged area, as well as for
the post-insult remodelling and recovery of neural function. Initial
events in astroglial responses to purinergic signalling appear to
be associated with P2Y1 and P2Y2 receptor-mediated Ca2þ astro-
glial signalling (Kirischuk et al., 1995). It has been claimed that
activation of P2Y2 receptors can promote regeneration of nerves
and glial cells in damaged brain (see Arthur et al., 2005; Franke,
2011). Intraneural injection of Ab has been shown to stimulate
regeneration of primary sensory axons in the spinal cord (Wu
et al., personal communication). The P2Y-like GPR17 has been
identiﬁed as a sensor of damage of the CNS and participates in
lesion repair in the rodent brain and in patients with traumatic
brain injury (Franke et al., 2013).

Synergistic actions of ATP and growth factors were recognised in
1989 (Huang et al., 1989). Sprouting of central neurons was shown
in experiments in which the enteric nervous system was trans-
planted into the striatum of the brain (Tew et al., 1992). It was
suggested that a growth factor released from enteric glial cells acts
synergistically with ATP (and its breakdown product, adenosine)
and NO (H€opker et al., 1996). A similar synergistic activity of pu-
rines and growth factors may be involved in stem cell activity
(Burnstock and Ulrich, 2011). Purines and pyrimidines released
from damaged cells stimulate astrocyte proliferation in vitro and
may contribute to astrocyte proliferation in vivo following injury to
the CNS (Christjanson et al., 1993). Co-operation of guanosine 50
triphosphate and nerve growth factor in neural differentiation and
neurite outgrowth has also been described (Gysbers et al., 2000;
Guarnieri et al., 2004).

Neural stem (progenitor) cells are heavily involved in the
development of the CNS and adult neural progenitor cells are also
involved in regeneration following injury (Shih et al., 2001;
Zimmermann, 2006; Lin et al., 2007; Trujillo et al., 2009; Ulrich
et al., 2012). It has been reported that stem cell activation and
the integration of newly formed neurons can be applied for neu-
roregeneration in the diseased brain (Martino and Pluchino, 2006;
Ormerod et al., 2008; Delic and Zimmermann, 2010). Neural
pluripotent precursor cells derived from primary neural stem cells
proliferate to form the three main cell types constituting the
neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, while microglia are
derived from immune-like cells. ATP causes proliferation of human
neural stem cells (Ryu et al., 2003). Adult neural progenitor cells in
the mouse subventricular zone express interacting functional
P2X4 and P2X7 receptors (Messemer et al., 2013a, b) and it has
been proposed that P2X2 and P2X7 receptor agonists and antag-
onists may provide novel tools for regeneration therapy in
neurodegenerative diseases (Glaser et al., 2013). In adult brains,
neural stem cells are present in the subventricular zone of the
lateral ventricle and the subgranular zone of the hippocampal
dentate gyrus, where neurogenesis continues throughout life.

Purinergic signalling promotes proliferation of rapidly dividing
stem cells in the subventricular region via P2Y1 receptors (see
Suyama et al., 2012). ATP was shown to promote locomotor re-
covery after spinal cord injury (Sun et al., 2013).

6. Conclusions

The P2X7 receptor subtype appears to be the dominant receptor
involved in CNS disorders, which is upregulated after trauma and
ischaemia and in inﬂammatory conditions. P1 and P2Y1 receptors
also participate in neuroprotective mechanisms. P2X7 receptor
antagonists are being explored for the treatment of neurodegen-
erative diseases, including AD, HD, MS and ALS. A2A receptor an-
tagonists are promising for the treatment of PD (see Table 1).

For major advances to be made in our knowledge of the roles of
purinergic signalling in neurodegeneration and neuroregeneration
there is an urgent need for novel compounds to be developed,
including purinoceptor subtype agonists and antagonists and in-
hibitors of ectonucleotidases and ATP transport, that are orally
bioavailable, stable in vivo and can cross the blood brain barrier.
There are questions to be raised about the viability of some of the
animal models currently available to replicate human CNS diseases.
