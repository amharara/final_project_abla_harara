The cytoskeleton protein Tau present

Abstract
in
oligodendrocytes (OLGs) promotes cellular process out-
growth and myelination; whereas abnormally hyperphos-
phorylated Tau has been shown to be present in the most
debilitating form of multiple sclerosis and in selective
dementias. This research examined the functional conse-
quences of expressing a truncated form of Tau in OLGs
during the second postnatal life. In particular, this truncated
form of Tau (DTau) retains the Fyn-binding domain but
lacks the microtubule-binding domain. Similar to hyper-
phosphorylated Tau, DTau cannot bind the cytoskeleton
and is missorted. The Cre/loxP recombination system was
used to generate transgenic (TG) founder lines, which
contain a Floxed LacZ-STOP cassette to prevent expres-
sion of enhanced green ﬂuorescence protein (EGFP)–
DTau. The founder
lines were then crossed with a
Tamoxifen (TM)-inducible proteolipid protein (PLP)-de-
pendent Cre driver line. Myelin PLP is the major myelin
protein in the central nervous system (CNS). TM was given
at postnatal day (p) 12 for 3 days, and CNS tissues were
collected at p22. Only TG mice with both EGFP–DTau and
Cre manifested an overt phenotype of loss of balance and
stumbles starting around p18. CNS tissues obtained from

TM-treated EGFP–DTau/Cre double transgenic mice had
recombined PCR products, GFP, and diminished brain
myelin. GFP was expressed in OLGs, but not in neurons or
astrocytes. On the contrary, TM-treated TG mice with only
one of the two transgenes, i.e., Cre or Tau, did not have
recombinant PCR products, GFP, diminished myelin, or
abnormal phenotype. Thus, this inducible model shows for
the ﬁrst time that a non-microtubule-associated Tau protein
in OLGs elicits both myelin decrease and gait abnormali-
ties, similar to the occurrence in selective demyelinating
and neurodegenerative diseases.

Introduction

The cytoskeleton of OLGs implements cellular process
outgrowth and myelination during postnatal development
[1–5] as a simple shaped bipolar OLG precursor cell goes
through extraordinary morphological changes in order to
extend as many as 50 cellular processes, each wrapping
distinct axonal segments. Cytoskeletal function is known to
be regulated by many factors, including the microtubule-
associated proteins [6]. Among the microtubule-associated

123

2189

proteins, Tau present in OLGs was previously shown to have
a critical role for both cellular process outgrowth and
myelination [7–11]. From studies done largely in neurons,
Tau is known to have a role in the regulation of motor-based
intracellular transport [12–18], which in OLGs plays a
critical role during myelin formation. Both axons and OLG
processes stain for Tau [7–11, 19]; however, Tau accumu-
lates in the somatodendritic compartments of neurons or in
the soma of OLGs in selective CNS degenerative diseases
when abnormally phosphorylated and/or mutated Tau
unable to bind to the cytoskeleton become missorted [20].
Indeed, Tau is missorted in neurons very early on during
Alzheimer disease with consequent deleterious microtubule
severing by spastin, trafﬁc jams, and synapse loss [20–22].
Tauopathies with an involvement of OLGs were shown in
selective dementias,
including progressive supranuclear
palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration, and frontotemporal
dementia which include Pick’s disease and some cases of
Alzheimer’s disease [23–29]. Notably, selective tauopathies
have both myelin and gait anomalies [30, 31]. In particular,
gait abnormalities have been reported in corticobasal
degeneration and in some clinical cases of frontotemporal
lobar degeneration [32–36]. Furthermore, recent studies
have also determined the presence of hyperphosphorylated
Tau and/or Tau aggregates in CNS tissue from experimental
autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), an animal model of
demyelinating multiple sclerosis (MS) disease [37, 38].
Noteworthy, hyperphosphorylated Tau was shown in OLGs
in the most severe form of MS, primary progressive MS
(PPMS), which manifests gait abnormalities from the very
onset of the disease [39]. Thus, although PPMS is not
considered to be a tauopathy for its pathogenesis, hyper-
phosphorylated, non-microtubule-associated, missorted Tau
in OLGs might contribute to the progressive, unremitting
degenerative aspects of MS. However, whether missorted
Tau in OLGs can initiate gait abnormalities in addition to its
effects on myelin is unknown. Thus, we developed a model
with inducible expression of a non-microtubule-associated
form of Tau protein known for its detrimental effects on
OLG processes and myelination.

retains

This form of truncated Tau (DTau) lacks the micro-
the SH3-binding
tubule-binding domain but
domain, which is responsible for 90 % of the binding of
Fyn to Tau [40]. Similar to the abnormally phosphorylated
Tau present in selective dementias, DTau cannot bind the
cytoskeleton, and is therefore missorted [11, 20, 41]. Most
important, the Fyn bound to DTau does not reach the tips of
axons or of OLG processes and distributes largely in the
cell body [11, 30, 41, 42].

Here, we present data from a TG mouse line with
inducible expression of DTau in OLGs. Upon expression of
DTau during the second postnatal
the mice had
decreased brain myelin and an irregular gait characterized

life,

by a loss of balance and stumbles. Thus, this model shows
for the ﬁrst time that a non-microtubule-associated form of
Tau protein in OLGs elicits both myelin decrease and gait
abnormalities, which might be relevant for the unremitting
aspects of the most aggressive form of MS and other
selective CNS degenerative diseases and dementias.

Materials and Methods

Generation of Floxed LacZ-STOP/EGFP–DTau
Founder TG Mice

The cDNA sequence coding for the EGFP-amino-terminal
Tau fragment ending at 684 was prepared by PCR. Amino-
terminal Tau fragment (DTau) was prepared using an adult
mouse Tau cDNA plasmid (from Dr. Gloria Lee, University
of Iowa) [43, 44] as a template (BioMeans, Inc). LacZ-
STOP ﬂanked by loxP sites was cloned 50 to EGFP–DTau
fusion gene construct. The SgrA I/Nar I transgenic fragment
was puriﬁed for pronuclear microinjection of C57BL/6
single-cell
fertilized zygotes using standard techniques
(BioMeans, Inc.; Transgenic and Targeted Mutagenesis
Laboratory at Northwestern University). Positive TG foun-
ders were identiﬁed by screening for the inheritance of the
transgene using PCR. The TG line was maintained by
crossing the founder line (LacZ-STOP/EGFP-DTau) with
wild-type mice. LacZ-STOP /EGFP-DTau mice were iden-
tiﬁed and bred with PLP:CreERT mice (45, Jackson Lab).
The resulting litter was genotyped to identify the mice with
both EGFP-DTau and Cre transgenes. Formal name of
founder TG mice: B6.Cg-Tg (CMV–EGFP/MAPT) 1Plop.
Formal name of double TG mice: B6.Cg-Tg (CMV–EGFP/
MAPT) 1 Plop Tg (Plp1-cre/ERT) 3Pop/Plop.

Ethics Statement

All experimental procedures described in the present work
were in accordance with Northwestern University Institu-
tional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved
protocols.

PCR Analysis

To identify Floxed LacZ-STOP/ EGFP–DTau founder TG
mice, DNA was obtained from TG mice tails using DNeasy
Tissue Kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Plasmid DNA was
heated at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by thirty-ﬁve reaction
cycles (95 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s) and a
single cycle of 72 °C for 5 min. Two primer pairs were used.
The primer pair (S1/A1), sense 50-ctgttttgacctccatagaagacac-30
and antisense 50-tgggaagggcgatcggt-30, speciﬁcally ampliﬁes
sequences upstream (292 bp) of LacZ; whereas primer pair

(S2/A2), sense 50-gttggtctggtgtcaaaaagcg-30 and antisense 50-
cgtccagctcgaccaggat-30, ampliﬁes
sequences downstream
(230 bp) of the LacZ region. A negative control with no DNA
was included in all the PCR assays. By mating the Floxed
LacZ-STOP/EGFP–DTau TG mice with PLP/CreERT TG
mice (Jackson Lab), PLP/CreERT: Floxed LacZ-STOP/
EGFP–DTau TG mice were generated. These TG mice were
identiﬁed using two primer pairs, i.e., one speciﬁc for the LoxP
sites upstream of LacZ (S1/A1) (292 bp), and the other one
speciﬁc for Cre (100 bp, Jackson Lab.). In contrast, to detect
recombined PCR products (217 bp) upon TM treatment, the
primer pair (S1/A2), sense 50-ctgttttgacctccatagaagacac-30 and
antisense 50-cgtccagctcgaccaggat-30, was used in a PCR reac-
tion with forty reaction cycles and a double amount of Taq.

TM Treatment

A 10-mg/ml TM (Sigma) stock suspension was prepared by
mixing 10 mg TM with 100 ll of ethanol and 900 ll of
sterile sunﬂower oil. The solution was brieﬂy heated up to
bring TM in solution. Fresh solutions were prepared weekly.
TM (1 mg) was given intraperitoneally to 12-day old TG
mice of unknown genotype for three consecutive days. TM-
treated single TG mice provided controls for similarly trea-
ted double TG mice. Mice were euthanized at p22.

were made at 10 lm for routine pathological examination and
immunohistochemistry. Selective sections were processed for
Luxol Fast Blue myelin staining. Slides were analyzed under a

In parallel
experiments, brains were removed, ﬁxed by immersion in 4 %
PFA in PBS and cryoprotected sequentially in 10 % sucrose
followed by 30 % sucrose; each performed overnight at 4 °C.
Finally, the tissue was embedded in OCT compound (Tissue-
Tek) and cryostat sections of brains (5 lm thick) were
mounted on Starfrost/Plus slides. Tissue sections were incu-
bated with anti-GFP (Genetex GTX20290, Rabbit 1:500) and
anti-APC (Abcam ab16794, Mouse 5 lg/ml) for 60 min at
room temperature. Parallel tissue sections were incubated
with anti-GFP and anti-GFAP (Sigma 9205, Mouse 1:500), or
with anti-GFP and anti-NeuN (Millipore MAB377, Mouse
5 lg/ml). Following incubation with primary antibodies,
slides were then treated with a serum free protein blocking
solution for 15 min at room temperature, and tissues sections
were incubated with Goat Anti-Mouse 594 secondary and
Goat Anti-Rabbit 488 secondary with an antibody titer of
1:400 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 45 min at room
temperature. Slides were then rinsed and mounted with

captured with an Olympus AX 70 ﬂuorescence microscope
(Northwestern University) or with a Zeiss LSM 710 Confocal
Microscope (Research Resources Center, University of Illi-
nois at Chicago).

Western Blot Analysis

CNS tissue was dissolved in a sample buffer (Invitrogen) and
sonicated for 5-10 min. Proteins were separated using SDS-
PAGE containing 10 or 4–12 % polyacrylamide and trans-
ferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes. The mem-
branes were incubated in a blocking buffer consisting of 5 %
nonfat dry milk in PBS-T (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm
NaCl, and 1 % Tween-20) overnight at 4 °C and incubated
1 h at room temperature in a blocking buffer with primary
antibodies (for MBP, SMI 94 Mouse monoclonal from
Covance Antibody Products, Berkley, CA, 1:10,000 dilution;
for GFP, Rabbit antibody GTX20290 from GeneTex,
1:10,000 dilution; for GAPDH, Rabbit antibody ab9485
from Abcam Inc., 1:2500 dilution). The membranes were
washed for 30 min with four intermediate changes with PBS-
T and incubated in a blocking buffer with horseradish per-
oxidase-conjugated donkey anti-Mouse or anti-Rabbit anti-
body (Cell Signaling Technology) at a dilution of 1:1000 for
1 h. at room temperature. After several washes with PBS-T,
proteins were visualized with Thermo Scientiﬁc Pierce ECL
Western Blotting Substrate according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Thermo Scientiﬁc) and visualized with a
chemiluminescent detection camera from BioRad. MBP
levels were normalized to the optical density of the GAPDH-
immunopositive bands. The intensity of the immunopositive
bands was quantitated by scanning in a MultiImager using
Quantity One software (Bio-Rad)
(Resource Center at
University of Illinois at Chicago; Proteomics Core Research
Facility, Rush University Medical Center).

Phenotype

The phenotype was recorded using a Sony digital still camera
(DSC-S980). The mice from three independent experiments
were videotaped. Loss of balance and falls were recorded and
expressed per time of walking activity. More than 4 min of
walking activity was analyzed per affected mouse.

Results

Generation of Floxed LacZ-STOP/EGFP–DTau
Founder TG Mice

To generate TG mice with inducible expression of
enhanced green ﬂuorescent protein (EGFP)–DTau, we

Neurochem Res (2015) 40:2188–2199

prepared a cDNA encoding EGFP–DTau protein under the
regulation of a CMV promoter, with a Floxed LacZ-STOP
cassette to prevent transcription of EGFP–DTau (Fig. 1a,
b). An amino-terminal fragment ending at base pair 684
was ﬁrst prepared by PCR using an adult mouse Tau cDNA
plasmid (from Dr. Gloria Lee, University of Iowa) as a
template (Fig. 1a). An SgrA I/Nar I transgenic fragment
was then puriﬁed for microinjection, and TG mice were
generated at
the Transgenic and Targeted Mutagenesis
Laboratory at Northwestern University by pronuclear
microinjection of C57BL/6 single-cell fertilized zygotes
using standard techniques. Floxed LacZ-STOP/EGFP–
DTau founder TG mice were identiﬁed by PCR using two
sets of primers upstream (primers S1/A1) and downstream
(primers S2/A2) of the LacZ cassette (Fig. 1b). These two
sets of primers (S1/A1 and S2/A2) produced PCR products
of 292 and 230 bp (Fig. 1b), respectively. To induce
expression of EGFP–DTau exclusively in OLGs, PLP/
CreERT: Floxed STOP-LacZ/EGFP–DTau TG mice were
obtained by crossing Floxed LacZ-STOP/EGFP–DTau
mice with a TM-inducible Cre driver line that regulates Cre
under the control of PLP promoter [45, 46]. Myelin PLP is
the major myelin protein in the CNS. PLP/CreERT: Floxed

LacZ-STOP/EGFP–DTau double TG mice were identiﬁed
with two primer sets, one speciﬁc for Tau (S1/A1, 292 bp)
and the other one for Cre (100 bp) (Fig. 2a) transgenes.

Gait Abnormalities and Brain Myelin Decrease
in TM-Treated EGFP–DTau/Cre Double TG Mice

By crossing Floxed LacZ/DTau TG mice with a TM-in-
ducible Cre driver line that regulates the recombinase under
the control of the PLP promoter [45], double TG mouse lines
with LoxP/Tau and Cre transgenes were obtained, together
with pups with only one transgene. Experiments were initi-
ated in 12-day-old offspring mice of unknown genotype with
TM injections given for 3 days (Fig. 2b). Only TG mice with
LoxP/Tau and Cre transgenes had an overt phenotype of an
abnormal gait, which became apparent around p18. The
abnormal gait was characterized by unsteady walk with loss
of balance and stumbles (videos in supplementary material).
At p22, analysis of walking activity of three affected TG
mice obtained from three independent experiments showed
that the mice fell every 13 s. (12.8 s ± 4.3 S.E.M., Fig. 2b).
Figure 2b shows also the time recorded for each mouse at
p22. Figure 3 shows that a Cre-mediated recombination

a Floxed LacZ-STOP /EGFP–DTau TG mice were bred with PLP/
CreERT mice [45] (Jackson Lab) that regulate Cre under PLP
promoter upon TM treatment. To identify PLP/CreERT: Floxed
LacZ-STOP/EGFP–DTau double TG mice, two primer pairs, i.e., one
speciﬁc for the LoxP sites upstream of LacZ (S1/A1) (292 bp), the
other one speciﬁc for Cre (100 bp, Jackson Lab.) were used. PCR of
two double positive [?] TG mice is shown in a. Formal name of

p12 for 3 days. Double TG mice (PLP/CreERT: Floxed LacZ-STOP/
EGFP–DTau) had an overt phenotype of an abnormal gait, which
became apparent around p18. The abnormal gait was characterized by
an unsteady walk with stumbles (videos, supplementary material). At
p22, analysis of walking activity of three affected mice obtained from
three independent experiments showed that the mice fell every 13 s.
(12.8 s ± 4.3 S.E.M., Fig. 2b)

results in a deletion of LacZ-STOP (Panel a). Double trans-
genic with overt phenotype had Cre-mediated recombination
as judged by PCR analysis using a primer set (S1/A2) that
ampliﬁes a 3.4-kb region from upstream to downstream of the
Floxed LacZ-STOP cassette (Fig. 3, Panel a). Representative
recombined PCR products (217 bp) detected in the cerebel-
lum genomic DNA obtained from a TG mouse double posi-
tive for the two transgenes are shown (Fig. 3b). Similar
results were obtained from the cerebra and spinal cord
obtained from TG mice double positive for the two transgenes
(data not shown). Notably, untreated and TM-treated single
TG mice did not present any phenotype abnormalities and
recombined PCR products. Finally, recombined PCR prod-
ucts were not detected in non CNS tissues (liver, heart and
spleen) obtained from TG mice double positive for the two
transgenes (data not shown). Furthermore, to determine GFP
protein expression, CNS tissue samples were blotted for GFP.
Figure 3c shows that cortex tissue samples obtained from two
TM-treated EGFP–DTau/Cre double TG mice had GFP-im-
munopositive bands in the expected molecular weight
(*60 kDa) (DTau: *30 kDa; EGFP: *30 kDa) (Fig. 3c,
Lanes 2 and 3), whereas control lacks GFP protein (Fig. 3c,
Lane 1). Since Belkadi and LoPresti [11] showed that the

expression of DTau in an OLG cell line impaired the myeli-
nating capacity of these cells when transplanted into an ani-
mal model of demyelination, we examined the levels of
myelin. Western blot analysis shows diminished myelin in
the brain of TM-treated double TG mice (Fig. 3d, lanes c, d,
and f). In particular, the optical density of myelin basic pro-
tein (MBP) levels normalized to Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) levels showed that experimental
mice (Fig. 3d, lanes c, d, f, and 2) have 43 % of myelin
compared with controls (Fig. 3d , lanes a, b, e, and 1).
(Mean ± S.E.M. 0.16 ± 0.043 n = 3 vs. 0.37 ± 0.038
n = 3, respectively; p = 0.0194), which represents a 2.3-
fold reduction. In addition, Luxol fast blue staining conﬁrms
myelin decrease in the brain of experimental versus control
mice (Figs. 1, 2; Supplementary material).

Conditional expression of GFP in OLGs of TM-
treated EGFP–DTau/Cre double TG mice

To assess whether Cre-mediated recombination results in
the expression of GFP-DTau in the CNS of TG mice

Fig. 3 Green-ﬂuorescent proteins expression and myelin decrease in
TM-treated PLP/CreERT: Floxed LacZ-STOP/ EGFP–DTau double
TG mice. a shows primer set (S1/A2) used to show Cre-mediated
recombination; recombined PCR products lack LacZ-STOP. b shows
representative recombined PCR products from cerebellum tissue
samples. Recombined PCR products (217 bp) were detected only in
CNS tissue from TM-treated double TG mouse (?). In contrast,
untreated (-) and TM-treated single TG (-) mice did not have any
recombined PCR products. c shows GFP immunoblot obtained from
brain samples from TM-treated double TG mice (lanes 2 and 3). GFP-
immunopositive band was detected in the expected molecular weight
(*60 kDa) (Dtau: *30 kDa; EGFP: *30 kDa) (lane 1, control;

GFP ﬂuorescence. TG mice were treated with TM at p12 for
3 days; CNS tissue was collected at p22. OCT-frozen CNS
tissue sections (with no immunostaining) ﬂuoresced bright
green under blue light excitation. GFP ﬂuorescence was
detected throughout the CNS in the spinal cord (Fig. 4, Panel
1), cerebellum (Fig. 4, Panel 2) and cortex (Fig. 4, Panel 3).
Furthermore, to identify the cell type expressing GFP, par-
allel sagittal brain tissues sections were incubated with anti-
GFP and cell-speciﬁc markers. Panel 4a (Fig. 4) identiﬁes
mature OLGs with an APC (adenomatous polyposis coli)
(red) OLG speciﬁc marker; Panel 4b (Fig. 4) shows GFP
(green) immunopositive cells, whereas Panel 4c (Fig. 4)
displays colocalization (yellow) of GFP with APC. Thus,
GFP is expressed in OLGs. In contrast, in Fig. 5, Panel 1a
identiﬁes GFAP (red) immunopositive astrocytes cells; Panel
1b shows GFP-positive cells (green), whereas Panel 1c dis-
plays a lack of colocalization (yellow) of GFP with astrocytic
marker GFAP. In addition, the morphological pattern of
GFAP immunostaining clearly identiﬁes the CNS region, i.e.,
the subventricular zone. Finally, in Fig. 6, Panel 1a identiﬁes

lanes 2 and 3, TM-treated double TG mice). d shows MBP
immunoblot of brain samples from TM-treated double TG mice (c,
d, and f) and control TM-treated TG mice (a, b, e). The optical density

Discussion

We describe a TG mouse line with inducible expression of
DTau in OLGs, which results in an overt phenotype charac-
terized by an irregular gait with frequent stumbles. To our
knowledge this is the ﬁrst report showing that a non-micro-
tubule associated form of Tau in OLGs initiates abnormal gait.
Previous studies showed myelin alterations at the time of
neurodegeneration in aged animals that over express Tau in
OLGs [47]. However, Belkadi and LoPresti [11] showed, to
our knowledge for the ﬁrst time, that Tau in OLGs has a role in
developmental myelination. This study conﬁrms and extends
previous ﬁndings regarding the role of Tau in OLGs during
developmental myelination. Noteworthy, it links a malfunc-
tion of Tau in OLGs with an effect on both myelin and gait.

The microtubule-associated protein Tau promotes cel-
lular process outgrowth and microtubule stability, regulates
intracellular transport [16, 17, 48, 49]. In contrast, abnor-
mally hyperphosphorylated forms of Tau and axonal
transport defects present in several CNS degenerative dis-
eases, including Alzheimer disease [50, 51], are common
features of selective progressive CNS degenerative pro-
cesses. Recently, tissues from experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis mice [37] and from MS [38, 39] were
also found to contain abnormally hyperphosphorylated
Tau. In particular, the most severe form of MS, the PPMS
variant, had prominent Tau pathology in CNS cells,
including OLGs. This most severe MS variant is known to
manifest gait abnormalities from the very onset of the
disease [39].

The functional consequences of DTau used in these
studies have been very well established in both neurons and
OLGs [10, 11, 20, 41, 52]. DTau binds Fyn, since it retains

its SH3-binding domain, but it cannot bind the cytoskele-
ton, because it
lacks the microtubule-binding domain.
Consequently, Fyn bound to DTau is not properly targeted
to axons or OLG processes [11, 20, 41]. Both abnormally
hyperphosphorylated Tau and DTau cannot bind the
microtubules and both forms of Tau are therefore missorted
[11, 20, 30, 41]. Thus, some functional consequences
observed in this study as a consequence of DTau might
then be present in selective dementias as a consequence of
abnormally hyperphosphorylated Tau in OLGs.

Conditional expression of DTau was obtained by using
the PLPERT mouse line [45], which has been widely used
with consistent high-efﬁciency recombination [46, 53, 54].
It is known that PLP is exclusively expressed in mature
OLGs; however, adult CNS is known to contain a popu-
lation of NG2 cells that express PLP [55]. Michalski et al.
[46] showed that PLP promoter-driven expression occurs in
NG2 cells and progressively diminishes from 20 to 5

percent in early (p4) versus late (p28) postnatal life. Future
studies will examine the extent of expression of DTau in
NG2 cells.

Recent studies have indicated that, in addition to its well
established role as microtubule-associated protein, Tau acts
also as a scaffolding platform, and in doing so it might
regulate selective signaling pathways [56, 57]. These
pathways might then be altered in the presence of a non-
microtubule-associated form of Tau.
Indeed the SH3-
binding domain retained by DTau and responsible for
binding to Fyn, has been shown in brain cells to bind also
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 K), phospholipase C
gamma1 (PLC) and Grb2 [58]. Thus, DTau might also
affect in vivo signaling pathways other than Fyn, which
might explain some of the effects observed in the inducible
mouse model described in these studies. For example, in
the context of the present study,
the PI3 K-dependent
pathway is known to have a role in myelination and cell

proliferation [59, 60], whereas the PLC pathway regulates
neuron-OLG interactions in the cortex [61]. Furthermore,
the N-terminal SH3 of Grb2 is known to regulate cell
proliferation [58]. Thus, the functional consequences of
expressing DTau may not be exclusively restricted to Fyn
being missorted, but might also include other selective
signaling pathways. However, to date only mistargeting of
Fyn has been shown in vivo in the presence of DTau [11,
20, 30, 41]. Perhaps as a consequence of a non-micro-
tubule-associated form of Tau, these additional signaling
pathways might play a detrimental role in adult CNS.
Similarly, alpha tubulin has the Fyn-binding domain so
DTau might interfere as well with some selective functions
of alpha tubulin. Future studies should then be done to test
these possibilities.

Previous work done with DTau-transfected cells trans-
planted in an animal model of demyelination, i.e., myelin-
deﬁcient rats, showed that DTau-transfected cells failed to

form myelin in the brain [11], whereas in this study OLGs
with inducible expression of DTau formed myelin in the
brain, although the amount of myelin was reduced com-
pared with controls. Since myelination is a developmen-
tally regulated event, the time of DTau expression would
determine the impact on myelination. Studies of trans-
plantation primarily determine the ability of DTau-ex-
pressing cells to start myelination, whereas DTau in TG
mice might also modulate ongoing myelination.

Healthy OLGs and myelin are essential for healthy
neurons and axonal integrity, and the interplay between
myelin and motor function has begun to be understood in
its complexity [54, 62–65]. Both myelin and gait abnor-
malities emerge as a result of pathologies along pathways
involved in the formation and/or integrity of myelin. The
mouse model presented in this study showed that DTau
decreased the levels of myelin with a resulting overt phe-
notype characterized by gait abnormalities. Clark et al.
[66] showed that gait abnormalities and progressive myelin
degeneration were found in a new murine model of Peli-
zaeus–Merzbacher disease with tandem genomic duplica-
tion of
In addition,
Harrington et al. [67] showed that OLG phosphatase and
tensin homolog (PTEN), which are involved in signaling
cascade, are required for both myelin and axonal integrity.
Notably, OLGs are now considered to have a role in the
pathogenesis of selective motor diseases. Philips et al. [68]
showed OLG dysfunction in the pathogenesis of amy-
otrophic lateral sclerosis, a neurodegenerative disease of

the proteolipid protein 1 gene.

motor neurons. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that
Tau KO mice suffer from muscle weakness and Parkin-
sonism [20, 69, 70]. Future studies would then have to
examine motor activity following deletion of Tau speciﬁ-
cally in OLGs. Finally, it is known that Tau missorting in
neurons causes trafﬁc jams [20, 22]; however, whether the
form of Tau used in these studies causes this same detri-
mental effect
in OLGs as well would require further
studies.

Current in vivo models of MS are not complete models
of human disease, but rather they model key aspects of it.
Animal models have improved our understanding and
treatment of MS, yet they have obvious limits [71, 72]. For
example, the EAE model has provided important insight
into the role of and therapeutic strategies aimed at immune-
mediated demyelination. On the other hand, the models
using Lysolethicin-
and Cuprizone-induced localized
demyelination have provided potential utility for testing
drugs for the repair of localized loss of myelin [73, 74]. In
contrast, the model presented in this study might have
some advantage in the context of selective CNS degener-
ative diseases which manifest both myelin and gait
anomalies.
