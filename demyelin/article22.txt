Autophagy plays an important role in maintaining the cellular homeostasis. One of its functions is to degrade 
unnecessary organelles and proteins for energy recycling or amino-acids for cell survival. Ablation of 
autophagy leads to neurodegeneration. Multiple sclerosis (MS), a permanent neurological impairment typical 
of chronic inflammatory demyelinating disorder, is an auto-immune disease of the central nervous system 
(CNS). Autophagy is tightly linked to the innate and adaptive immune systems during the autoimmune process, 
and several studies have shown that autophagy directly participates in the progress of MS or experimental 
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE, a mouse model of MS). Dysfunction of mitochondria that intensively 
inﬂ uences the autophagy pathway is one of the important factors in the pathogenesis of MS. Autophagy-related 
gene (ATG) 5 and immune-related GTPase M (IRGM) 1 are increased, while ATG16L2 is decreased, in T-cells 
in EAE and active relapsing-remitting MS brains. Administration of rapamycin, an inhibitor of mammalian target 
of rapamycin (  mTOR), ameliorates  relapsing-remitting EAE. Inﬂ ammation and oxidative stress are increased 
in MS lesions and EAE, but Lamp2 and the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio are decreased. Furthermore, autophagy in 
various glial cells plays important roles in regulating neuro-inﬂ ammation in the CNS, implying potential roles in 
MS. In this review, we discuss the role of autophagy in the peripheral immune system and the CNS in neuro-
inﬂ ammation associated with the pathogenesis of MS.

Introduction

Autophagy, a lysosome-dependent degradation pathway, 
contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis. Clearance 
of  long-lived  proteins,  unnecessary  organelles,  and 
aggregate-prone proteins is mainly executed by autophagy 
for recycling cellular materials[1]. There are three subtypes 
of  autophagy,  macroautophagy,  chaperone-mediated 
autophagy (CMA), and mitophagy. Macroautophagy is the 
major type for selective degradation of protein aggregates 
or misfolded proteins. The ubiquitin-labeled proteins are 
recognized by autophagy receptors, such as p62, neighbor 
of BRCA1 gene 1 (NBR1), and NIP3-like protein X (NIX), 

to form autophagosomes that then fuse with lysosomes 
for degradation. Many autophagy-related genes function 
during this process, such as Unc51-like kinase (ULK1) 
and autophagy-related gene (ATG) 5. Mammalian target 
of rapamycin (mTOR) represses autophagy by regulating 
ULK1 phosphorylation, while AMPK activates this process. 
CMA mediates the degradation of large molecular-weight 
proteins containing the KFERQ motif recognized by heat 
shock cognate protein of 70 kDa (HSC70). The substrate is 
then escorted to lysosome-associated membrane protein 
2  (LAMP2A)  for  lysosomal  degradation.  Mitophagy  is 
responsible for the degradation of damaged mitochondria. 
Parkin and PINK1 play critical roles in this process[2]. More

attention has been paid to autophagy in the pathogenesis of 
neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease 
(AD)[3], Parkinson’s disease (PD)[4] and amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS)[5]. 

M u l t i p l e   s c l e r o s i s   ( M S )   i s   a   n o n - i n h e r i t e d 
neurodegenerative disease characterized by the involvement 
of innate and adaptive immunity. MS occurs mainly in 
young adults and its incidence in females is two to three 
times higher than that in males. About 85% of MS patients 
show relapse-remission before irreversible progression. 
It is widely accepted that MS is an auto-immune disease 
caused by autoreactive T-cells that target the myelin sheath 
in the central nervous system (CNS)[6, 7]. These myelin 
sheath-targeting T-cells infiltrate the CNS via breakdown 
of the blood brain barrier, attack the myelin sheath, and 
initiate chronic inflammatory responses, leading to the 
loss of axons and neurons. The fact that adoptive transfer 
of  activated  myelin-specific  CD4+ T-cells  can  induce 
experimental  autoimmune  encephalomyelitis  (EAE) 
demonstrates that auto-immunity is indispensable in the 
pathogenesis of MS[8]. Genome-wide association studies 
have shown that immunologically-relevant genes, especially 
T-helper-cell  differentiation  genes,  are  significantly 
overrepresented in the pathogenesis of MS[9]. However, 
it is still unclear what exactly causes the disease. One of 
the initiators of MS is antigen from virus or bacteria that is 
similar to the myelin basic protein peptide[10, 11]. The auto-
immunity hypothesis is now being challenged since the 
ﬁ nding that, like many other neurodegenerative disorders, 
gray matter lesions and brain atrophy are detectable before 
MS onset[12, 13]. So the initiators of MS still need further 
investigation. An  important  factor  in  MS  development 
is  neuro-inflammation,  which  is  also  one  of  the  main 
characteristics of MS (chronic inflammation, infiltration of 
peripheral immune cells, demyelination, transected axons, 
and gliosis). The frail neurons die when they are exposed 
to the inﬂ ammatory environment. Pro-inﬂ ammatory factors 
such as IL17 impair the differentiation of oligodendrocyte 
progenitor cells (OPCs) in MS[14].

Autophagy is tightly linked with auto-immune diseases, 
including  MS[15-17].  The  extracellular  matrix  molecule 
fibronectin aggregates in chronically demyelinating MS 
and the relapsig phase of EAE; it may be resistant to 
degradation  and  affect  the  remyelination  process[18]. 
Soluble oligomers have been detected in the brain and 

cerebral spinal ﬂ uid of MS patients[19]. Meanwhile, oxidized 
protein  aggregates  increase  in  EAE,  probably  due  to 
the  reduced  autophagy  level[20].  Moreover,  autophagy 
intensively regulates inﬂ ammation in various diseases. To 
unravel the potential role of autophagy in the pathogenesis 
of MS, we highlight its possible importance in both the 
generation of auto-reactive lymphocytes and the regulation 
of neuro-inflammation. Differential cell-type specificity of 
autophagy in the peripheral immune system and the CNS  
might modulate the onset and progression of MS (Fig. 1).

Autophagy and Mitochondria in MS

Mitochondria play important roles in general and selective 
autophagic  flux,  including  mitophagy.  Dysfunction  of 
mitochondria during stress is one of the important factors 
involved in the pathogenesis of MS and EAE. Autophagy 
maintains the architecture of mitochondria, restores their 
function, and prevents their dysfunction, which are critical 
for cell survival and the pathogenesis of MS[21-23]. In MS, 
the decreased expression of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 
5b may impair the function of mitochondria[24]. Dysfunction 
of mitochondria produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), 
which  contribute  to  demyelination  and  axonal  loss[25]. 
Autophagy clears depolarized mitochondria to reduce the 
excessive production of ROS by increasing BECN1 or 
regulating ATG4 activity[26, 27], which is protective in MS.

Autophagy and MS in the Peripheral Immune System
Mutual Regulation of Autophagy and Inﬂ ammation
The connections between autophagy and inﬂ ammation are 
complex. Each regulates the other by different mechanisms. 
Pattern-recognition receptors for pathogen recognition, 
such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like receptors 
(NLRs) can elicit autophagy for pathogen clearance[28]. 
However, autophagy negatively regulates inflammation to 
prevent the harmful amplification of inflammatory factors. 
For  instance, ATG9  suppresses  the  stimulator  of  IFN 
genes protein (STING) in type-I IFN signaling to reduce 
the  inflammatory  response[29].  Blockade  of  autophagy 
leads to the activation of inflammasomes which control 
the proteolytic processing and secretion of IL -1β and IL-18 
under inﬂ ammatory stress[30, 31]. Also, ablation of autophagy-
related 16-like 1 (ATG16L1) increases the production of

and IFNγ, can induce autophagy in macrophages or microglia. H: Cell debris or protein aggresomes in MS or EAE are removed

astrocytes during neuro-inﬂ ammation. Depolarized mitochondria are also removed by autophagy.

IL-1β and IL-18 in the mouse model of Crohn’s disease[32]. 
Moreover, infection of ATG5-deﬁ cient myeloid cells with M. 
tuberculosis increases the expression of IL-17, a potent 
mediator in autoimmunity[33]. In primary effective T-cells, 
p62 serves as a receptor for autophagic degradation of 
ubiquitinated BCL10 during TCR activation to protect cells 

from excessively activated NF-κB pathway[34].

Inflammatory factors in turn regulate the progress of 
autophagy. The T-helper 1 (Th1) cell cytokine IFNγ  induces 
autophagy in macrophages to suppress the survival of 
mycobacteria[35]. Another  pro-inflammatory  factor, Tnf, 
also induces autophagy in monocytes/macrophages[36]. 

438

Neurosci Bull     August 1, 2015, 31(4): 435–444

However, the Th2 cell cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 ablate  
autophagy in macrophages[36]. 
Autoreactive T-Cell Regulation by Autophagy
Besides  innate  immunity,  autophagy  also  participates 
intensively in shaping the adaptive immune system. Th1 
cells are crucial at the early stage of MS pathogenesis, and 
Th17 cells are indispensable in the later stage. Autophagy 
is necessary for the generation of autoreactive T-cells. It 
participates in multiple functions of the adaptive immune 
system, such as antigen presentation and maintenance of 
the homeostasis of T-cells.

Autophagy  mediates  antigen-presentation  during 
the  generation  of  autoreactive  T-cells. Autophagy 
enhances antigen-presentation to CD4+ T-cells via major 
histocompatibility complex class II molecules[37, 38]. In thymic 
epithelial cells, autophagy contributes to the positive and 
negative control of the T-cell repertoire, playing a critical 
role in the elimination of self-reactive T-cells and exotic 
pathogens. Mice thymi with ATG5 ablation show inﬁ ltration 
of  autoreactive  CD4+ T-cells  into  multiple  organs  and 
induce  autoimmune  colitis  similar  to  Crohn’s  disease-
related phenotypes[38]. Atg7 ablation in dendritic cells (DCs), 
the  most  potent  antigen-presenting  cells,  ameliorates 
EAE. Blockade of autophagy in DCs by chloroquine also 
delays the onset or reduces the severity of EAE[39]. DCs 
from patients with Crohn’s disease with ATG16L1 and 
NOD2 variants are defective in antigen presentation[40]. The 
presentation of citrullinated peptides by DCs, macrophages, 
and thymic DCs is blocked by inhibition of autophagy with 
3-methyladenine[41]. 

Autophagy regulates the homeostasis, proliferation, 
differentiation, maturation, and apoptosis of T-cells. It also 
maintains the calcium flux and the pro-survival process 
and counteracts pro-apoptotic action to maintain T-cell 
homeostasis[42-45]. Cyt1 induces autophagosome formation 
when it binds to CD46, which may function in maintaining 
the homeostasis of T-cells during adaptive immunity[46]. 
Moreover, the expression of ATG16 L2 in T-cells is reduced, 
and this is likely to perturb the homeostasis of T-cells in 
MS[47]. ATG5 plays important roles in T-cell survival and 
controls the proliferation, differentiation and maturation 
of CD4/8+ T-cells and B-cells[48-50]. mTOR-deficient T-cells 
fail to differentiate into T-helper cells, Th1, Th2, and Th17 
effector cells[51, 52]. ATG5 is signiﬁ cantly elevated in T-cells 

in MS lesions and EAE mice compared to controls. The 
increase of autophagy in T-cells may promote their survival, 
contributing to the pathogenesis of MS[53]. Immune-related 
GTPase M1 is highly expressed in MS lesions in the CNS 
and EAE models, and contributes to the pathogenesis 
of MS by increasing the survival of autoreactive CD4+ 
T-cells[17]. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, ameliorates 
the  relapsing-remitting  EAE  (RR-EAE)  in  SJL/j  mice 
by increasing the Treg cell population[54]. However, the 
contributions of autophagy in different T-cell populations 
to cell death depend on the context. Upon activation of 
autophagy, Th2 cells undergo growth factor-withdrawal-
mediated cell death[55]. The induction of autophagy through 
binding of HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins to CXC chemokine 
receptor 4 of CD4+ T-cells is necessary for apoptosis[56]. 
FADD or casp8 in T-cells limits autophagy and protects 
against cell necrosis and inﬂ ammation[57, 58]. Alteration of the 
proportions of different T-cell groups affects the immune 
response[59]. 

Pathological Role of Autophagy in MS
Autophagy and Neuro-inﬂ ammation
CNS autophagy is linked with serious neurodegenerative 
diseases. Deﬁ ciency of basal autophagy in neurons leads 
to  protein  aggregation  and  finally  neurodegenerative 
diseases[60, 61]. Neuro-inﬂ ammation is one of the important 
factors that cause neurodegenerative diseases, especially 
MS. Autophagy and neuro-inflammation regulate each 
other to affect the progression of various diseases in the 
CNS.

Neuro-inflammation  is  negatively  regulated  by 
autophagy  to  avoid  its  harm  to  the  CNS.  Microglia, 
resident immune cells in the CNS, play important roles 
in the initiation and sustenance of neuro-inflammation 
to  clear  pathogens.  They  produce  pro-inflammatory 
factors and neurotoxic factors including ROS and nitric 
oxide (NO). Subsequently-activated astrocytes further 
amplify the inflammatory response to produce more pro-
inflammatory factors, chemokines, and NO, which have 
toxic effects on primary neurons[7, 62]. However, autophagy 
plays an essential role in maintaining neuro-inflammation 
at  a  harmless  level. Activation  of  Drd1  by  dopamine 
inhibits NOD-LRR-containing pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) 
inflammasome activation through autophagic degradation 

Peizhou Liang, et al.    Role of   autophagy in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis

439

of NLRP3 via the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH7[63]. The 
dopamine system also regulates lymphocyte activity in 
lupus and MS, suggesting an important role of dopamine in 
the regulation of peripheral or CNS inﬁ ltrated lymphocytes 
during the pathogenesis of MS[64, 65]. In addition, inhibition 
of neuro-inﬂ ammation by autophagy has great beneﬁ ts on 
ischemia[66]. Autophagy may be a stress response to the 
negative feedback regulation of neuro-inﬂ ammation. In the 
chronic LPS model, pro-inﬂ ammatory factor IL-1β in cortex 
is positively correlated with the autophagy markers Beclin-1 
and LC3-II and inversely correlated with p62[67]. 

Autophagy  can  be  deleterious  depending  on  the 
disease. Activation of the autophagic pathway in ischemia 
leads to the death of astrocytes and neurons, which can be 
rescued by autophagy inhibitors[68, 69]. Meanwhile, blockade 
of microglial autophagy in permanent middle cerebral artery 
occlusion by autophagy inhibitors reduces the severity 
of the disease[70]. Thus, autophagy in different diseases 
and cell types in the CNS seems to function differently. 
Autophagic cell death is still under debate and needs 
further investigation[71].
Autophagy in Glial Cells
Until  recently,  most  studies  on  autophagy  in  the  CNS 
focused on neurons, with less on glial cells. The activation 
of glial cells plays important roles in neuro-inflammation, 
and these cells are indispensable for the development of 
MS[7]. MS progression occurs between glial activation and 
gliosis. Autophagy in various glial cells may play a role in 
responding to stress in MS. Therefore, it is urgent to study 
the effect of glial autophagy on neurological diseases, 
including MS.

Microglia are the first line of defense in the CNS, 
monitoring  exotic  and  intrinsic  pathogens.  During 
demyelination,  cell  debris  is  mainly  phagocytized  by 
microglia  or  microphages,  a  process  that  requires 
autophagy-related genes[72]. Impairment of autophagy in 
microglia may hinder debris clearance, leading to damaged 
remyelination  and  augmentation  of  persistent  neuro-
inflammation. The rapid activation of microglia produces 
pro-inﬂ ammatory cytokines and free radicals, and acts as 
the major antigen-presenting cell[73, 74]. Pro-inflammatory 
factors such as IL-1β can trigger microglial autophagy, 
suggesting links between autophagy and inflammation 
activation[75].  mTOR  plays  a  pivotal  role  in  autophagy 
suppression and promotes inﬂ ammation in microglia, and 

rapamycin may have a beneficial effect in the treatment 
of MS[76]. mTOR inhibitors reduce neuro-inflammation by 
inhibiting microglial activation or viability, decreasing pro-
inﬂ ammatory cytokines[77]. Simian immunodeﬁ ciency virus-
infected microglia attenuate the survival of neurons by 
inhibiting neuronal autophagy[78], which implicates a cell-
cell type regulation of autophagy in the CNS. However, 
microglial autophagy in middle cerebral artery occlusion 
makes the disease worse[70]. It is possible that the role of 
microglial autophagy depends on the disease.

Astrocytes  are  the  primary  supportive  elements 
for  neuronal  structure  and  neurotrophy,  comprising 
~50% of cells in the adult mammalian brain. Autophagy 
is  necessary  for  the  differentiation  and  maturation 
of  astrocytes[79],  and  can  be  initiated  in  inflammatory 
stress and may be important in the development of MS. 
During pro-inflammatory stimuli, autophagy is induced 
to maintain mitochondrial networks[22]. Impairment of the 
autophagy pathway by ablation of Atg7 in astrocytes in 
the inflammatory environment amplifies the response to 
produce more neurotoxic factors such as ROS, which 
induces astrocytic cell death[22, 80]. mTOR in the astrocyte 
may play a protective role in ischemia via its downstream 
kinase S6K1[81]. mTOR can also regulate the stability of 
iNOS mRNA in astrocytes, reducing the neurotoxic effect 
of NO which impairs autophagy by disrupting the BECN1 
complex and activates mTORC1[82-84]. 

OPCs  are  indispensable  during  oligodendrocyte 
differentiation and myelin remyelination; they are activated 
for remyelination in MS lesions[85, 86]. They also play an 
important role in MS pathogenesis by modulating immune 
activity in the CNS. Act1 deletion in OPCs blocks the IL-17 
pathway, attenuating neuro-inflammation and increasing 
OPC  maturation[14].  OPCs  can  also  clear  β-amyloid 
peptides  by  triggering  endocytosis  and  autophagy[87], 
implying an autophagic role of OPCs in MS. However, the 
exact functions of OPCs in MS need further investigation, 
including  those  of  autophagy  and  its  differentiation, 
nutritional support, debris clearance, and inflammation 
regulation.

Demyelination and Remyelination
Autophagy  is  closely  linked  to  demyelination  and 
remyelination.  It  plays  potential  roles  in  improving 

440

Neurosci Bull     August 1, 2015, 31(4): 435–444

Schwann cell remyelination in demyelinating peripheral 
neuropathies[88]. Rapamycin, a potent autophagy inducer, 
improves  myelination,  leading  to  enhanced  neuronal 
survival in tuberous sclerosis[89]. Meanwhile, in Long–Evans 
shaker rats, an increased autophagy level increases the 
number of myelinated axons and myelin sheath thickness 
during dysmyelination and demyelination, which implies 
that the autophagy pathway is a direct target for therapy 
for  demyelination[90].  Furthermore,  high  mobility  group 
box chromosomal protein 1 (HMGB1), which promotes 
autophagy, is elevated in MS and EAE[91]. However, the 
progression of MS and EAE involves many cell types. 
Different cell types in the lesion site might show different 
patterns  of  autophagy.  In  MS,  especially  in  the  acute 
phase, nerve growth factor (NGF) is dramatically increased 
in  the  cerebrospinal  fluid[92].  NGF  inhibits  autophagy 
and cell death of neurons through the p75 neurotrophin 
receptor,  suggesting  a  protective  role  in  MS[93].  In  MS 
lesions,  Lamp2  expression  is  reduced[94],  implying  an 
impairment of autophagy. The mTOR signaling pathway 
that inhibits autophagy restores the regrowth of axons in 
the CNS, which is important for remyelination in MS[95, 96]. 
Moreover, in acute and chronic EAE, protein aggresomes 
in the spinal cord and a reduced LC3-II/LC3-I ratio suggest 
that the protein turnover mechanism through autophagy 
is impaired[20]. In fact, the mechanism of autophagy in 
the pathogenesis of MS in the CNS is still superficially 
understood. Autophagy in different stages of the disease 
and  different  cell  types  needs  further  investigation  to 
determine the causal relationship between autophagy and 
MS.

Conclusive Remarks

So  far,  little  is  known  about  the  exact  mechanism  of 
autophagy in MS. It is still controversial whether autophagy 
leads  to  cell  death  in  MS  or  is  a  rescue  mechanism 
activated  as  part  of  an  endogenous  neuroprotective 
response, since autophagy plays opposite functions in 
inflammation and cell survival, depending on the context. 
Drugs modifying the immune system and remyelination 
have been used to help with relapse management, reduce 
the degree of disability, and improve the quality of life[97, 98]. 
The effects of rapamycin and chloroquine in the therapy of 
EAE shed light on the autophagy pathway as a potential 

target for drug development. The inhibition of autophagy 
in mesenchymal stem cells provides a novel strategy to 
improve therapeutic effects by enhancing the suppression 
of CD4+ T-cells[99]. In order to develop effective and more 
speciﬁ c therapeutic strategies, we need to fully understand 
the  complex  interplay  between  autophagy  and  MS  in 
different cell types.
