Abstract

Objectives
Inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the CNS comprise a broad spectrum of diseases
like neuromyelitis optica (NMO), NMO spectrum disorders (NMO-SD) and multiple sclerosis
(MS). Despite clear classification criteria, differentiation can be difficult. We hypothesized
that the urine proteome may differentiate NMO from MS.

Methods
The proteins in urine samples from anti-aquaporin 4 (AQP4) seropositive NMO/NMO-SD
patients (n = 32), patients with MS (n = 46) and healthy subjects (HS, n = 31) were examined
by quantitative liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) after trypsin
digestion and iTRAQ labelling. Immunoglobulins (Ig) in the urine were validated by nephe-
lometry in an independent cohort (n = 9–10 pr. groups).

Results
The analysis identified a total of 1112 different proteins of which 333 were shared by all 109
subjects. Cluster analysis revealed differences in the urine proteome of NMO/NMO-SD
compared to HS and MS. Principal component analysis also suggested that the NMO/
NMO-SD proteome profile was useful for classification. Multivariate regression analysis
revealed a 3-protein profile for the NMO/NMO-SD versus HS discrimination, a 6-protein pro-
file for NMO/NMO-SD versus MS discrimination and an 11-protein profile for MS versus HS

discrimination. All protein panels yielded highly significant ROC curves (AUC in all cases
>0.85, p0.0002). Nephelometry confirmed the presence of increased Ig-light chains in the
urine of patients with NMO/NMO-SD.

Conclusion
The urine proteome profile of patients with NMO/NMO-SD is different from MS and HS. This
may reflect differences in the pathogenesis of NMO/NMO-SD versus MS and suggests that
urine may be a potential source of biomarkers differentiating NMO/NMO-SD from MS.

Introduction
Inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the CNS include putative autoimmune diseases like
multiple sclerosis (MS), neuromyelitis optica (NMO), and NMO spectrum diseases
(NMO-SD) e.g. relapsing and/or bilateral inflammatory optic neuritis (RION/BON), and lon-
gitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM). Despite recognition of pathogenic antibodies
against the water channel aquaporin 4 (AQP4) in the majority of patients with NMO/
NMO-SD[1–3], diagnosis of especially seronegative cases can be challenging and underlines
the need for additional biomarkers[4, 5]. Accurate diagnosis is nevertheless vital since misdiag-
nosis can lead to incorrect medication and deterioration[6].

Mass spectrometry has made it possible to uncover distinct molecular components in both

serum and CSF of patients with NMO[7, 8] and MS[9]. Proteomic pattern analysis can globally
and quantitatively characterize the protein population and may effectively reveal distinct and
complex pathogenesis of seemingly closely related diseases, such as MS and NMO/NMO-SD.
Previous non-quantitative studies have isolated biomarkers from CSF and serum[7, 8], while
other body fluids remain to be been explored.

Urine has a relatively stable protein composition and may be obtained in large quantities

non-invasively. It is considered as an attractive source of biomarkers[10] and the human urine
proteome have been characterized by several techniques[11, 12]. Clinically applicable urine
biomarkers have been identified even for diseases of the CNS[13].

In this study, we used high accuracy, high resolution quantitative mass spectrometry to

characterize the urine proteome of healthy subjects (HS) and patients with seropositive NMO/
NMO-SD and MS and investigated if the different pathophysiology of NMO may be reflected
in the urine proteome profile.

Materials and Methods
Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations, and Patient Consents

KK4/2010, 42341-2/2013/EKU) as well as the Danish Ethics Committee of Region of Southern
Denmark (S–20120066). Written consent was obtained from all participants prior to entering
the study.

Study Population

The Urine Proteome Is Different in NMO

For validation of Ig light chains in urine, an independent cohort of samples was collected
(n = 9–10 pr group) (table 1, cohort 2). NMO/NMO-SD was diagnosed according to the Win-
gerchuk 2006[14] and the AQP4-seropositive NMO-SD criteria of EFNS[3], and their antibody
status verified by a cell based assay (Euroimmune, Germany).

All MS cases fulfilled the McDonald’s 2010 criteria[15]. HS did not suffer from autoimmune

or neurological disorders (table 1). Neither MS nor NMO/NMO-SD patients had experienced
a relapse within 30 days of the sample collection.

Sample Preparation and Mass Spectrometry
Spot urine was collected and centrifuged within 2 hours before stored at -80°C until use. Sam-
ples containing blood, nitrite (Multistix 7, Siemens Healthcare), low protein content (<0.01
mg/ml), or displaying albumin/creatinine ratios >10 were excluded (Fig 1A). The sample
cohort then consisted of 31 HS, 32 NMO/NMO-SD, and 46 MS samples.

Supernatants were filtered through 10 kDa cut-off spin-filters (Amicon). The retentates
were washed in 500μl 5 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer, re-suspended, reduced,
alkylated and trypsinated[16]. Ten μg peptide aliquots were collected from each sample and
labelled with isobaric tags (iTRAQ 8-plex): Mass tag 113 was assigned to 10μg of a HS pool;
mass tag 114: 10μg of a NMO/NMO-SD pool; mass tag 115: 10μg of a MS pool; mass tags 116,
117, 118, 119, and 121: 10μg of randomly chosen HS, NMO/NMO-SD, and MS samples. The
labelled samples were pooled into 24 8-plex sets, dried, re-dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic
acid, purified (WATERS, 5mg/well) and eluted[16] before separated into 11 fractions by
hydrophilic interaction chromatography and analysed as previously described[16].

Proteome Data Processing and Protein Quantification
A combined MASCOT-SEQUEST search was performed as described[16]. Tandem mass spec-
tra were searched against the Swissprot database restricted to humans. Proteins were inferred on
the basis of at least two unique peptides identified with high confidence. False-discovery rates
(FDR) were obtained using Percolator selecting identification with a q-value 0.01. iTRAQ
quantification was performed using Proteome Discoverer with reporter ion area integration
within a 20ppm window. Ratios were normalized against the median peptide ratio. Ratios of dis-
eased individuals (reporter ions 116–119 and reporter ion 121) versus the pool of HS (reporter
ion 113) were used for statistical analysis. The ratios of HS (113) vs. NMO/NMO-SD pool (114)
and MS pool (115) were used as a measure of the technical variability (8.1%).
immunofluorescence (Euroimmune, Germany) with crude samples or diluted 1:10, 1:20, and
1:40. For the detection of light chains, kappa (Ig-κ) and lambda (Ig-λ), samples from cohort 2
were analyzed by rate nephelometry (Siemens BN ProSpec instrument; detection limit:
7.11mg/L (Ig-κ) and 3.9mg/L (Ig-λ)), Ten NMO/NMO-SD samples from cohort 1 with high
content of light chains served as positive controls (Fig 1B).

Data Handling and Statistics
Relative intensities based on iTRAQ peptide counts in each sample group were tested for sig-
nificant inter-group differences using unpaired two-sided t-tests in Microsoft Excel. The num-
ber of proteins found in more than 1 sample in each of the compared groups were: 1094
(NMO/NMO-SD vs. HS), 1075 (NMO/NMO-SD vs. MS), and 1029 (MS vs. HS), respectively.
These numbers were used for the FDR adjustment. Data were z-transformed and hierarchically
clustered using proteins present in >80% of the samples with p<0.05 and in subsequent

shown. (A) Cohort 1: After initial screening and analysis of 176 urine samples, 67 samples were excluded due
to presence of blood, nitrite, high albumin/creatinine ratio or low protein content. The remaining 109 samples
were analysed as individual samples by quantitative LC-MS/MS proteomics compared to control groups of
pooled samples of AQP4-seropositive NMO/NMO-SD, MS and HS samples, respectively, to yield 1112
proteins. (B) Cohort 2: For validation of increased Ig and AQP4 antibody excretion, samples from an
independent cohort of patients with AQP4-seropositive NMO/NMO-SD (n = 9–10 pr group) were subjected to

formed as previously described[19].

For risk probability calculation and optimal discrimination of NMO/NMO-SD vs. HS,

NMO/NMO-SD vs. MS, and MS vs. HS samples, respectively, logistic regression was applied.
Input data were filtered according to different stringency criteria. Thus, modeling used

expression values for: (1) proteins present in all samples (333 proteins); (2) proteins present in
>80% of the samples in each group (520 proteins), and (3) proteins present in >2 samples in
each group (1021 proteins). Missing values were assigned the value 0 for multivariate modeling.
The feature selection and risk probability calculation were conducted as follows: 1) Calculating
the univariate logistic regression based significance differentiating the 3 groups. 2) Ranking the
proteins according to their univariate logistic regression significance. Modeling was limited to
proteins with p0.05. 3) Developing logistic regression models differentiating either group[19].
Model performance was assessed by the area-under-curve (AUC) of the associated Receiver
Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and checked for invalidity as previously described[19].

Results
Protein Characteristics and Principal Component Analysis
A total of 1112 proteins were identified by 2 peptides (Fig 1, S1 Table). Of these, 333 proteins
were detected in all 109 samples (Fig 2A). By PCA of all 333 shared proteins, the two first prin-
cipal components did not account for more than 30–33% of the variation. Except for the PCA
plot of the NMO/NMO-SD and HS cases, no separation according to groups was apparent (Fig
2B–2D). However, when we included only proteins significantly expressed (p<0.05) compared
to HS and present in >80% of the samples, the data contained information enabling the separa-
tion of the NMO/NMO-SD group from both HS and MS (Fig 2E and 2F, respectively),
although less clear when comparing MS to HS (Fig 2G).

FDR Adjustment Identifies Proteins Significant for NMO/NMO-SD and
MS Discrimination
We then compared NMO and MS samples using FDR adjustment to only allow entries with an
FDR (q-value) <0.05 (Fig 3). In this way, we determined several proteins that discriminated
NMO/NMO-SD from HS. The identified proteins are involved in biological functions such as
leukocyte trafficking, demyelination and neuroinflammation (S2 Table). Three protein compo-
nents of Igs (the gamma–3 (Ig-G3), Ig-κ and Ig-λ) were significantly upregulated in the NMO/
NMO-SD samples compared to the HS group (Fig 3A and 3B), while others were downregulated.
ROC curve analysis revealed AUC of 0.8 (p = 0.0001) in the NMO/NMO-SD vs HS comparison
for all the three Igs (Fig 3C). Using an independent set of 10 samples from each of the three
groups, we were unable to detect anti-AQP4 antibodies in urine by indirect immunofluorescence
using M23 transfected cells. Although the light chains were detected in 20–30% of the NMO/
NMO-SD samples from cohort 1 by nephelometry, only one NMO/NMO-SD sample (10%) con-
tained Ig-κ and Ig-λ above the nephelometric detection threshold in cohort 2 (Fig 3D).

When adjusting for multiple comparisons at FDR <0.05, we identified proteins involved in

leukocyte trafficking and myelin degeneration (S2 Table), which discriminated NMO/
NMO-SD from MS (Fig 4A). IgG3 was significantly upregulated in NMO/NMO-SD compared
to MS (Fig 4B) while the rest were all downregulated. Analysis of MS vs. HS revealed one dis-
criminating protein (CD9), which was downregulated in MS compared to HS (S2 Table).

Development of Diagnostic Classifiers
To optimize protein-based discrimination between NMO/NMO-SD, MS and HS from urine,
we next applied logistic regression to check for protein combinations as potential diagnostic
classifiers.

Based on the 333 proteins detected in all 109 samples the classification analysis showed that
a 3-protein profile was the optimal model (ROC AUC = 0.93, p<0.0001) for discriminating HS

The Urine Proteome Is Different in NMO

Thus, specific urine protein patterns could distinguish NMO/NMO-SD from MS and HS

with a high discriminatory power (AUC >0.85 and p<0.0001 in all three cases).

Discussion
In this study, we demonstrate that the urine proteome profile is different in patients with
AQP4-seropositive NMO/NMO-SD compared to MS and HS. This is to our knowledge the
first study to use high accuracy mass spectrometry to characterize the urine proteome of
patients with NMO/NMO-SD and MS, although urine has been used as a source of biomarkers
in other neurological diseases[13, 20].

Although new classification criteria of NMO/NMO-SD have been published very recently,
which uses a unifying terminology of NMO-SD with or without AQP4 antibodies[21], in this
paper we still use the widely accepted NMO/NMO-SD definition since patients were diagnosed
based on the 2006 criteria[3].

Due to the high accuracy of the mass spectroscopy method used, we were able to identify

a high number of proteins in the urine; one-fourth of these were shared by all samples.
Quantitative analysis with univariate tests and statistical correction for multiple compari-
sons revealed that the NMO/NMO-SD proteome is useful for classification. Thus, we deter-
mined a total of 31 proteins, which were significantly different between NMO/NMO-SD and
HS, 4 proteins were different between NMO/NMO-SD and MS, and 1 protein between MS
and HS. In addition to the univariate analyses, the optimum combination of variables for
discriminatory risk scores was determined by multivariate logistic regression. Out of the 31
proteins significantly different between NMO/NMO-SD and HS, a 3-protein combination
defined a highly significant model for discriminating HS from NMO/NMO-SD. Likewise,
the protein that could discriminate MS from HS was also part of the discriminating protein
profile along with 10 other proteins. However, out of the 4 proteins that were significantly
different between NMO/NMO-SD and MS, only 3 (cadherin–2, proactivator polypeptide
and ICAM–2) turned out to be included in the 6-protein profile revealed by multivariate
regression analysis.

The pathogenesis of the two diseases probably overlaps. Both are considered inflammatory
demyelinating diseases although the primary immunopathogenesis may be different. In MS it
is widely accepted that the inflammatory process is caused or propagated by an autoimmune
cascade involving myelin reactive T cells, resulting in widespread demyelination and neuronal
and axonal degeneration[22–24]. Deposition of pathogenic antibodies and complement activa-
tion may be more prominent in NMO, while axonal degeneration is less pronounced[1–3, 25].
However, MS is not a homogenous disease[24]. This can be one reason for the more heteroge-
neous proteome of the urine compared to both HS and NMO/NMO-SD. Indeed, an 11-protein
profile was optimal for MS versus HS discrimination compared to the 3-protein and 6-protein
profiles of NMO/NMO-SD versus HS and NMO/NMO-SD versus MS discrimination, respec-
tively. Several distinct immunopathological profiles of MS have been suggested, even including
humoral immune mechanisms to a variable degree[24, 26, 27]. B cells, plasma cells, autoanti-
bodies and complement have been detected in MS lesions and in CSF[28, 29].

Among the proteins significantly differentiating NMO/NMO-SD from HS, 3 types of Ig

chains were found to be upregulated (IgG3, Ig-κ, Ig-λ light chains). Ig consists of two identical
heavy chains of α, γ, δ, ε or μ, and two identical light chains of κ or λ kappa or type [30]. The
fact that we found the Ig-G3 heavy chain and the two light chains to be significantly increased
in the urine of NMO/NMO-SD patients suggests an increased excretion of Igs or Ig fragments.
However, rate nephelometry could confirm this increased excretion of Ig light chains, only in 3
out of 10 NMO/NMO-SD samples from cohort 1—all with high Ig content by LC-MS/MS, and

in 1 of the 10 samples of an independent cohort. This lower sensitivity may be due to the lower
sensitivity of immunonephelometric assays.

The fact that both heavy and light Ig chains were significantly increased in the mass spec-

trometry analysis of NMO/NMO-SD urines could indicate that specific antibodies or antibody
fragments are increased. Considering that all NMO/NMO-SD patients in the present study
were AQP4-seropositive, it is tempting to speculate that the specifically increased Igs, including
the IgG3 are in fact AQP4-antibodies but this could not be confirmed by immunoassays. How-
ever, it is unlikely that intact antibody molecules are present in the urine samples, and the indi-
vidual identifications of heavy and light chains may presumably originate from in vivo-
fragmented immunoglobulin molecules. Since serum levels of anti-AQP4 antibodies have been
shown to be elevated during relapse[31, 32], it is tempting to investigate if this is also reflected
in the urine. However, as all patients in this study are stable on medication this falls beyond the
scope of the study and would greatly limit the sample size of this group.

Many of the proteins that discriminated NMO/NMO-SD, MS and HS have been implicated

in biological processes like leucocyte trafficking, blood-brain barrier breakdown, demyelin-
ation, myelin degradation and neuroinflammation. However, the majority of these were down-
regulated in the urine of patients with NMO/NMO-SD. Due to the highly sensitive technique
we were still able to detect these downregulated proteins, but they are less likely to serve as
potential biomarkers. Such downregulation also raises the question of increased protein degra-
dation in the urine and/or sera of NMO/NMO-SD and MS patients. Extensive protein degrada-
tion, however, would have been expected to lead to fewer detected proteins in NMO/NMO-SD
and MS samples, and this was not observed. In our proteomic setup the normalization of the
samples was based on the protein concentration. Therefore, it is unlikely that variances in the
quantitative protein content were responsible for such differences between NMO/NMO-SD,
MS and HS. Furthermore, we excluded more than one third of the samples that were visibly
contaminated by blood, or had high albumin/creatinine ratio or nitrite content to avoid
patients with possible infection or kidney dysfunction. Nevertheless, considering that AQP4 is
also expressed in the kidney and Ig chains were increased in the urine, it is tempting to specu-
late whether such decrease in particular proteins or altered degradation within the protein rep-
ertoire of the urine is indicative of an underlying subtle kidney dysfunction caused by AQP4
antibodies, which can be detected only by a very sensitive assay, such as LC-MS/MS. Indeed,
cases with elevated creatinine kinase in the peripheral blood related to the clinical activity of
NMO/NMO-SD have been reported, which may indicate a pathological role of AQP4-antibo-
dies in extra-neuronal tissues expressing AQP4[33, 34].

Altogether, we identified around 1100 different proteins in the urine and one-third of these
were found in all samples. These numbers largely agree with a previous work, where 1543 pro-
teins including a large proportion of membrane proteins were identified in the urine of healthy
donors[35]. In that study, protein identification was based on single peptide identifications (in
addition to tandem mass spectra), while all protein identifications in the present study were
more stringently based on the presence of at least 2 unique peptides. The former study identified
32 Ig species (and a number of hypothetical proteins of which some are of Ig nature) including
the same distribution of κ and λ light chains that we observe in the present study, but none of
the 3 specific significantly increased entries that we observe in the NMO/NMO-SD samples.

This is not study without limitations. First, using spot urine may have confounded the data
analyses. Ideally this study would have been performed on fasting morning urine to eliminate
any confounders due to changes in hydration or diet. By standardizing the protein content in
the samples and discarding samples with low protein content we attempted to correct for dif-
ferences in hydration. While we cannot adjust for any dietary differences, it is unlikely that

great dietary variations exist between the groups. Furthermore any individual differences may
only have served to undermine any statistical significant differences presented in this study

Second, the data interpretation may be confounded by the heterogenous medical treatments

of the patient cohorts. The majority of samples from MS patients were collected just prior to
the next treatment of natalizumab, meaning that the last injection would have been given 30
days before and is therefore less likely to be found in the urine as opposed to the therapies like
interferon-beta with more frequent administrations.

Nevertheless, in a subanalysis, MS patients treated with natalizumab and interferon-beta were

compared and we could not find significant differences in the urine proteome (not shown).

Third, only the Ig content of the urine has been validated in an independent cohort using a
different method beside proteomics. Diagnostic classifiers should be validated in a large inde-
pendent cohort consisting of both seronegative and seropositve patients including patients
with active relapses. Furthermore specific proteins should be quantitated by immunoassays or
single reaction monitoring mass spectrometric assays.

Despite these reservations, we here show that urine is an attractive source of biomarkers,
which have so far been neglected in neurological contexts, despite its clear advantages over
other body fluids. This study demonstrates that the use of high accuracy mass spectrometry in
combination with multivariate regression analysis can reveal differences in the urine proteome
that reflect differences in the pathology of distinct demyelinating diseases, and may serve as
source of potential biomarkers.
