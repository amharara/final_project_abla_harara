Central nervous system (CNS)-inﬁltrating effector T cells play critical
roles in the
development and progression of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, current drugs for MS are
very limited due to the difﬁculty of delivering drugs into the CNS. Here we identify a
cell-permeable peptide, dNP2, which efﬁciently delivers proteins into mouse and human
T cells, as well as various tissues. Moreover, it enters the brain tissue and resident cells
through blood vessels by penetrating the tightly organized blood–brain barrier. The
dNP2-conjugated cytoplasmic domain of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (dNP2-ctCTLA-4)
negatively regulates activated T cells and shows inhibitory effects on experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis in both preventive and therapeutic mouse models, resulting in
the reduction of demyelination and CNS-inﬁltrating T helper 1 and T helper 17 cells. Thus,
this study demonstrates that dNP2 is a blood–brain barrier-permeable peptide and
dNP2-ctCTLA-4 could be an effective agent for treating CNS inﬂammatory diseases
such as MS.

Multiple sclerosis is a human autoimmune disease caused

by the induction of inﬂammation in the central nervous
system (CNS) by myelin-speciﬁc T cells that cross
the protective environment of the blood–brain barrier (BBB)1.
The mouse model
experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), induced by interferon-g
(IFN-g) or interleukin-17A (IL-17A) expressing T helper 1 (Th1)
or T helper 17 (Th17) cells following MOG35–55 immunization,
has been intensively studied2,3. Th1 and Th17 cells inﬁltrate the
CNS, including the brain and spinal cord, and in high levels of
these cells induce inﬂammation and nerve cell apoptosis3,4.

of multiple

sclerosis,

Although these effector cells could be potent

therapeutic
targets, the BBB and the blood–spinal cord barrier (BSCB) greatly
restrict the delivery of therapeutic biomolecules into the CNS5,6.
Various
strategies have been developed to overcome the
restrictions on drug delivery imposed by the BBB/BSCB7.
Opening the barrier by stimulating tight
junctions in the
BBB/BSCB, through the use of biological, chemical or physical
stimuli, has been the most widely used method of drug delivery.
For example, Cereport, a synthetic peptide that can disrupt
tight junctions, has been widely studied for BBB permeability and
therapeutic approaches8,9. The use of high-intensity-focused
ultrasound has also been investigated to physically enhance
drug delivery into the CNS for therapeutic purposes10. Another
strategy uses
via
adsorptive-mediated transcytosis of barrier cells. For instance,
the most well-known CPP, TAT, was fused with the anti-
apoptotic protein B-cell
lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xl) and
delivered to the murine brain as a treatment for ischaemic
brain injury11,12. Other CPPs, such as SynB1/3, have also been
used to deliver drugs across
the BBB. SynB1-conjugated
doxorubicin or penicillin and SynB3-conjugated dalargin exhibit
signiﬁcantly increased brain uptake13–15.

cell-permeable peptides

(CPP)

However, because all of the above methods originate from
synthetic chemicals or other organisms and may have long-term
toxicity or other side effects, which limit their clinical applications
in humans, further improvements are needed to obtain a safe,
efﬁcient system for drug delivery into the CNS. In the current
study, we identiﬁed and optimized a human-derived CNS-
permeable CPP and applied it to an EAE model via conjugation
with the cytoplasmic domain of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen
4 (ctCTLA-4) to control autoimmune effector T-cell responses in
the CNS.

signals

CTLA-4 is an immune regulatory receptor expressed on the
surface of T cells and interacts with the B7 molecules expressed
on antigen-presenting cells, thereby competing with CD28 and
to T cells16–19. The Ctla-4
transmitting negative
gene consists of four exons, which encode the leader sequence
(exon 1), the extracellular ligand-binding domain (exon 2), the
transmembrane region (exon 3) and the cytoplasmic tail (exon 4).
Alternative splicing of the Ctla-4 gene results in the expression
of various CTLA-4 isoforms,
including full-length CTLA-4,
soluble CTLA-4,
ligand-independent CTLA-4 (liCTLA-4) and
exon 1/4 CTLA-4 (1/4CTLA-4)20. The importance of liCTLA-4,
which lacks the ligand-binding domain,
in negative immune
regulation was demonstrated in murine T cells21. In primary
the liCTLA-4 protein inhibits T-cell activation by
T cells,
dephosphorylating the T-cell receptor
(TcR) z-chain. These
studies revealed that
the cytoplasmic tail of CTLA-4 could
deliver negative signals without B7 binding to the extracellular
ligand-binding domain. We
also previously reported that
intracellular delivery of a recombinant CTLA-4 cytoplasmic
domain (ctCTLA-4) efﬁciently inhibited phosphorylation of the
TcR z-chain and mitogen-activated protein kinase, resulting in
amelioration of allergic airway inﬂammation and autoimmune
arthritis in experimental animal models22,23.

Here we initially identify a novel CPP, dNP2, from the human
novel LZAP-binding protein (NLBP). This peptide exhibits
potent protein delivery efﬁciency in primary mouse and human
T cells in vitro and even in brain tissue, as determined in vivo
using live multi-photon confocal microscopy. We then purify
recombinant dNP2-conjugated ctCTLA-4 protein, which displays
a signiﬁcant suppressive effect on the activated T cell responses,
and we further elucidate its preventive and therapeutic effects on
MOG35–55-induced autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice.

Results
Identiﬁcation and optimization of a dNP2. To identify a novel
human origin CPP, we performed homology searches against
the human proteome database using previously reported CPP
sequence information. We identiﬁed candidate CPP sequences
from the human NLBP, which consists of 794 amino acids and
contains two functional regions: residues 1–212, which are
required for E3 UFM-1 ligase activity, and residues 121–250,
which are involved in CDK5RAP3-binding activity24,25. On the
basis of BLAST homology analysis, two candidate sequences,
which are highly conserved among various species, were selected:
NP1
(444–454;
KIKKVKKKGRK; Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1). To examine
the intracellular protein delivery activity of these CPP candidates,
we initially constructed plasmids expressing enhanced green
ﬂuorescent proteins (EGFPs), including NP1-EGFP, NP2-EGFP,
and EGFP without a CPP, and then puriﬁed the resulting
proteins (Supplementary Fig. 2), as previously described26. These
proteins were examined by incubation with cultured cells to
determine
transduction efﬁciency. Flow
cytometric analysis demonstrated that signiﬁcant transduction
of the NP1-EGFP and NP2-EGFP proteins into Jurkat T cells
occurred in both concentration- and time-dependent manners
(Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 3). We then determined whether
the tandem repeats of NP1 or NP2 (dNP1 or dNP2) or a
combination of the two candidates (NP1-2 or NP2-1) exhibit
higher delivery efﬁciencies
forms.
Interestingly, only dNP2-EGFP exhibited dramatically enhanced
delivery efﬁciency; dNP1, NP1-2 and NP2-1 did not exhibit any
signiﬁcant enhancement of intracellular transduction efﬁciency
compared with the monomeric form (Fig. 1c, Supplementary
Fig. 4). The cell-penetrating ability of dNP2 was at least twofold
greater than that of TAT or R9 (Fig. 1d), which are well-known
CPPs with numerous applications27–29. In addition, dNP2-EGFP
exhibited efﬁcient
localization into both the
cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 1e). To obtain a clearer
analysis of nuclear localization, we used a brighter ﬂuorescent
protein, dTomato. Substantial
intracellular dNP2-dTomato
ﬂuorescent signal was detected within 30 min and was clearly
localized in the nucleus after 2–6 h (Fig. 1f). Although
intracellular delivery of dTAT-EGFP and dHph-1-EGFP was
also signiﬁcantly increased compared with their monomeric
forms, dNP2-EGFP exhibited substantially higher efﬁciency
than the other tested proteins (Supplementary Fig. 5a). The
enhancement of protein delivery efﬁciency of dNP2 compared
with NP2 was more signiﬁcant than the protein delivery efﬁciency
ratio of dTAT/TAT or dHph-1/Hph-1 (Supplementary Fig. 5b).
Next, we intraperitoneally injected 5 mg of
the dTomato,
TAT-dTomato or dNP2-dTomato proteins into mice. After 2 h,
signiﬁcant dTomato ﬂuorescence was observed in the various
tissues,
of
dNP2-dTomato-injected mice and the intensity was brighter
and clearer than that of TAT-dTomato (Fig. 1g). On higher
magniﬁcation ( 200), dTomato ﬂuorescence was co-localized
with nucleus in stained cells in the tissues and we conﬁrmed the

transaminase activity in the serum (Fig. 1i), weight, sizes of the
spleen, liver and brain, or apoptotic cells and activated T cells
(Supplementary Fig. 7). These results suggest that dNP2 from
human NLBP is a potent novel CPP that can deliver functional
macromolecules, such as proteins, into cells both in vitro and
in vivo without signiﬁcant toxicity.

Efﬁcient protein delivery by dNP2 into primary T cells.
Although most CPPs have been evaluated in various cancer cell
lines in vitro, their penetrating efﬁciency is generally much lower in
primary cells, which severely limits the clinical applications of
CPPs in humans30. Next, we further examined the delivery
efﬁciency of dNP2 in primary mouse splenocytes and human
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Mouse splenocytes
treated with 5 mM dNP2-EGFP displayed 62.4% EGFP-positive
cells, while the cells treated with TAT-EGFP or EGFP alone
showed 16.6 and 2.59% EGFP-positive cells, respectively, thereby
demonstrating the superior intracellular protein delivery efﬁciency
of dNP2 in mouse splenocytes (Fig. 2a,b). Similar results were
observed in human PBMCs (Fig. 2c,d), suggesting that dNP2 leads
to very efﬁcient delivery of proteins in primary hematopoietic cells,
while TAT is much less efﬁcient. Interestingly, both the TAT- and
dNP2-EGFP proteins were delivered more
efﬁciently into
phagocytic cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells than
into lymphocytes, while dNP2 still showed signiﬁcantly better
delivery efﬁciency in CD4 T cells than did the other controls
(Fig. 2e,f). To compare and visualize the efﬁciencies of dNP2 and
TAT in primary T cells, we performed live-cell imaging using
magnetic-activated cell sorting-puriﬁed total CD4 T cells from
C57BL/6 mice. Whereas the ﬂuorescence intensities of T cells
treated with 1 mM EGFP and TAT-EGFP remained near basal
levels throughout the 2 h imaging period, the average ﬂuorescence
intensities of dNP2-EGFP-treated T cells increased linearly and
reached a plateau within 30 min (Fig. 2g,h), suggesting that dNP2,
but not TAT, is suitable for efﬁcient functional protein delivery
into primary T cells.

Intracellular delivery mechanisms of dNP2. To determine
the intracellular delivery mechanisms, we initially examined the
delivery efﬁciency of
the dNP2-EGPF protein at different
including 4, 25 and 37 °C (Fig. 3a). The
temperatures,
intracellular delivery efﬁciencies decreased at lower temperatures,
suggesting that delivery may possibly be mediated by energy-
dependent mechanisms. We then examined whether the delivery
mechanism involves interactions with cell membrane molecules
such as glycosaminoglycans, as in the case of the other CPPs31,32.
Heparin, a competitive inhibitor of heparan sulphate on the cell
surface, treatment signiﬁcantly inhibited the delivery efﬁciency
of dNP2 (Fig. 3b), suggesting a requirement for interaction
with glycosaminoglycans. Next, we analysed delivery efﬁciency
of dNP2-dTomato protein in mouse CD4 T cells with various
endocytosis
(clathrin-
mediated endocytosis inhibitor)33, Amiloride (macropinocytosis
inhibitor)34
lipid
raft-mediated endocytosis inhibitor)35, to determine their effect
on intracellular delivery. The intracellular delivery efﬁciency
of the dNP2-dTomato protein was signiﬁcantly decreased only by
MbCD treatment (Fig. 3c–e), suggesting that a lipid raft-mediated
endocytosis pathway is one of
the major mechanisms of
intracellular delivery. Because the delivery mechanism of TAT
peptide has been reported to also involve clathrin-mediated
endocytosis and macropinocytosis33, we hypothesized that
peptides and proteins might have different intracellular delivery
mechanisms. When mouse splenocytes were incubated with 5 mM
TAT- or dNP2-TAMRA peptide with or without chlorpromazine,

including chlorpromazine

cyclodextrin (MbCD,

and methyl-beta

inhibitors,

amiloride or MbCD, the intracellular delivery efﬁciencies on
CD4-positive cells of both the TAT- and dNP2-TAMRA peptides
were signiﬁcantly inhibited by all of the inhibitors, suggesting that
the dNP2 peptide alone seems to use multiple endocytosis
pathways (Fig. 3f–h). In addition, equivalent pattern was found in
total splenocytes (Supplementary Fig. 8). Finally we conﬁrmed
and visualized intracellular delivery efﬁciency of dNP2-dTomato
protein in HeLa cells was signiﬁcantly inhibited by MbCD
treatment (Fig. 3i). Collectively, our results demonstrate that the
intracellular delivery mechanism of dNP2 is identical to that
reported for other CPPs, and utilizes various endocytosis
pathways depends on cargos,
including lipid raft-mediated
endocytosis following heparan sulphate interaction.

dNP2 delivers cargo proteins into the CNS in vivo. The high
protein-delivery efﬁciency of dNP2 in primary T cells, which
are generally the most difﬁcult of cells to transfect, prompted
us to investigate the membrane-penetrating efﬁciency of dNP2
in brain. To visualize the CNS-permeable ability of dNP2, we
performed real-time in vivo multi-photon confocal imaging of
mouse brains after intravenous injection of 2.5 mg dTomato,
TAT-dTomato, Hph-1-dTomato or dNP2-dTomato proteins.
Although each injection allowed the successful visualization of the
vasculature of the intact mouse brain via red ﬂuorescence after
40 min, the red ﬂuorescence signal diffused out of the vasculature
and into cellular structures only in animals injected with dNP2-
dTomato (Fig. 4a). In the case of TAT- and Hph-1-dTomato
injections, signiﬁcant diffusion into cellular structures was not
observed; however, the diffusion of dNP2-dTomato ﬂuorescence
out of blood vessels increased in a time-dependent manner up to
120 min after injection (Fig. 4b). Using frozen brain tissue sections,
staining
the
dNP2-dTomato protein signal was
signiﬁcantly co-localized
with neurons (Neuronal Nuclei (NeuN)-positive cells), astrocytes
(Glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells) and microglial
cells (Ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1)-positive
cells), suggesting that the dNP2-dTomato protein was successfully
delivered into brain cells through the blood vessels (Fig. 4c).
Next, we conﬁrmed the intracellular delivery efﬁciency of dNP2-
dTomato in the brain and spinal cord tissues in MOG33–55-
immunized inﬂammatory EAE mice. The dNP2-dTomato signal
was signiﬁcantly detected in the inﬂammatory brain and spinal
cord tissues (Fig. 4d), and was also co-localized with CD4-positive
cells in the brain (Fig. 4e), suggesting that dNP2 can deliver a
protein into inﬁltrating T cells in the brain. These results suggest
that dNP2 can deliver functional proteins into the brain and spinal
cord tissues and into resident or migratory cells; thereby suggesting
its valuable application potency in CNS inﬂammatory diseases.

Figure 2 | Protein delivery efﬁciency of dNP2 in primary mouse and human immune cells. (a,b) Mouse primary splenocytes were isolated from 6-week-
old female C57BL/6 mice and the cells were incubated with 5 mM EGFP, TAT- and dNP2-EGFP for 2 h. Intracellular ﬂuorescence was analysed by ﬂow
cytometry and the data are represented as dot plots or mean ﬂuorescence intensity (MFI) of the cells. (c,d) Human PBMCs were isolated from healthy
donor blood and the cells were incubated with 5 mM EGFP, TAT-, dNP2-EGFP for 2 h. The data were analysed as described above. (e) Total splenocytes
were incubated with 1 mM EGFP, TAT-, and dNP2-EGFP for 2 h. Cells were gated using markers speciﬁc for CD4 T cells (CD4þ ), B cells (CD19þ ),
macrophages (CD11cloCD11bhiF480þ ) and DCs (CD11chiMHCIIhi). The EGFP signal in each cell population was then analysed by ﬂow cytometric analysis.
The relative MFI value was normalization to PBS treated cells. The red line indicates relative MFI of PBS-treated cells. (f) Total PBMCs were incubated with
1 mM EGFP, TAT-, and dNP2-EGFP for 2 h. Cells were gated with markers speciﬁc for CD4 T cells (CD4þ ), B cells (CD19þ ), macrophages (CD11bþ ) and
DCs (CD11cþ ) and the data were then analysed as described above. (g) Time-lapse images of mouse CD4 T cells incubated with 1 mM EGFP, TAT- and
dNP2-EGFP were acquired for 2 h (Scale bar, 15 mm) and (h) the average ﬂuorescence intensities of 10 cells from each sample were calculated and plotted.

(Fig. 5d). Next, to assess the inhibitory effects of dNP2-ctCTLA-4 in
a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, we used C57BL/6 mice
immunized with the MOG35–55 peptide and treated with pertussis
toxin, a standard EAE model. We began intraperitoneal treatment
with 25 mg dNP2-ctCTLA-4 on day 7 and continued treating the
mice every other day. The clinical scores of the mice treated with
dNP2-ctCTLA-4 protein were signiﬁcantly lower than those of that
treated with dNP2-EGFP or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS;

Fig. 5e). Then we performed histological analysis of the spinal
cord tissue with Luxol fast blue (LFB) and hematoxylin and eosin
staining to determine neuronal damage, such as demyelination and
tissue inﬂammation levels. The histological analysis of the spinal
cord tissue from dNP2-ctCTLA-4-treated mice showed reduced
cellular inﬁltration and demyelination compared with the other
group (Fig. 5f,g). This

correlated with a reduced proportion and number of inﬁltrated

Figure 4 | Protein delivery efﬁciency of dNP2 in brain and spinal cord. 2.5 mg dTomato, Hph-1-, TAT-, and dNP2-dTomato proteins were intravenously
injected into 8-week-old male C57BL/6 mice through the tail vein after anaesthesia for real-time live confocal microscopic analysis. (a) Mouse brains were
observed at 40 min after injection via multi-photon confocal microscopy using a 3D lateral view and 3D top view or magniﬁed 3D top view (Scale bar,
100 mm). (b) The ﬂuorescent diffusion of the dNP2-dTomato protein out of blood vessels in the brain was monitored from 20–120 min (Scale bar, 50 mm).
(c) Co-localization of the dNP2-dTomato (red) signal with ﬂuorescent signals speciﬁc for various cell types, including neurons (NeuN, green), astrocytes
(GFAP, green), and microglia (Iba-1, green), in frozen sectioned brain tissue following confocal microscopy ( 400, Scale bar, 50 mm) is indicated by white
arrows. White boxes in the merged images are magniﬁed regions. (d–e) EAE was induced in mice as described in the Materials and Method section, 2.5 mg
of the dTomato or dNP2-dTomato proteins were subsequently injected intravenously. After 1 h, the brain and spinal cord tissues were harvested and
prepared as frozen slides. (d) The cellular localization of the dNP2-dTomato protein in the brain or spinal cord tissues was visualized by ﬂuorescence
microscopy ( 100; Scale bar, 200 mm,  400; Scale bar, 50 mm). (e) The co-localization of the dNP2-dTomato protein with CD4-positive cells (green)
was analysed by ﬂuorescence microscopy ( 400, Scale bar, 50 mm) and is indicated as white arrows.
100 mg dNP2-ctCTLA-4 into mice that had already developed the
disease and whose average clinical
score was 1 (Fig. 5k).
Remarkably, dNP2-ctCTLA-4 was able to ameliorate the clinical
scores of EAE. Collectively, our data suggest that dNP2-ctCTLA-4
could regulate activated T-cell response in vitro and in vivo and it
could be used as an immune-modulatory protein to control CNS
inﬂammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis.

from the human NLBP protein. dNP2 is a tandem repeated form
of the NP2 sequence that is highly conserved among various
species. dNP2 exhibits potent
intracellular protein delivery
activity both in vitro and in vivo. We used in vitro and in vivo
live-cell
imaging technologies to directly visualize the dNP2-
meditated internalization of macromolecules, such as proteins
into T cells or brain cells that are generally regarded to pose huge
hurdles for drug delivery. Moreover, we generated a dNP2-
conjugated therapeutic protein, using the cytoplasmic domain of
CTLA-4, to regulate T-cell responses in an EAE model and
observed signiﬁcant reductions in disease symptoms in both
preventive and therapeutic applications.

Discussion
In the present study, we identiﬁed and optimized a novel CNS-
permeable cell membrane-penetrating peptide, dNP2, derived

the HIV-1 Tat protein36. A fusion protein consisting of an 11
amino-acid sequence (TAT) from the Tat protein along with the
b-galactosidase protein (TAT-b-gal, 120 kDa) was reported to be
delivered into cells,
including brain tissue, both in vitro and
in vivo37. Various previously characterized CPPs,
including
Antp38, Pep-1 (ref. 39), VP22 (ref. 40) and polyarginine41, have
also been shown to deliver effector peptides or proteins into cells.
CPPs have been widely used to transduce various cargo
molecules, including proteins, peptides, small interfering RNA
and plasmid DNA, into cells to manipulate cellular responses42–
44. Recently, polyarginine-conjugated transcription factors, such
as Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc, have been used in the generation
of induced pluripotent stem cells45. Moreover, CPP-conjugated
molecules have been studied in clinical
trials. Polyarginine-
conjugated cyclosporine A was the ﬁrst clinical-tested CPP-
conjugated molecules in phase II trials for the treatment of
psoriasis, which was ultimately discontinued in the current46.
And the TAT-conjugated protein kinase C d inhibitor (KAI-
9803) has completed phase II clinical trials for the treatment of
attack patients47. However, no Food and Drug
heart
Administration-approved CPP-based drugs are available, yet
implying that the existing CPPs may have less efﬁciency in
human or have side effects such as toxicity. Some previous studies
have attempted to improve the intracellular delivery efﬁciency of
TAT using a tandem repeated form of TAT-CPP (dTAT)48,49.
Although dTAT showed much higher delivery efﬁciency than
TAT, we conﬁrmed that dNP2 exhibits much more potent
intracellular protein delivery than dTAT in primary T cells
in vitro, and in various tissues including brain tissue in vivo
(Supplementary Figs 9 and 10). Moreover, our
results
demonstrated that dTAT has more signiﬁcant in vitro toxicity
than dNP2, suggesting that dNP2 has more advantages over than
dTAT for the application purposes.

Previously, the delivery of cargo molecules into brain tissue by
TAT peptide was evaluated by indirect methods, such as b-gal
enzyme assays37 or secondary antibody-based ampliﬁcation50.
We, however, visualized the delivered ﬂuorescent protein in the
brain tissue of live animals; a direct methodology for tracking
protein in vivo. We found that only dNP2 delivers proteins into
brain cells, including neurons, astrocytes and microglia, through
the blood vessels in the brain, while the TAT- and Hph-1-CPP-
conjugated proteins mostly remained in the blood vessel. From
this, we can deduce that dNP2 may deliver a protein through
blood vessels into neurons, astrocytes and microglial cells, which
have characteristics to enable uptake of dNP2 proteins. Neuronal
cells essentially have endocytosis activity for the recycling of
cellular membrane after release of neurotransmitters51 and
astrocytes and microglial cells are well-characterized phagocytes
in the CNS, which have phagocytic activity to clear apoptotic
cells or debris52. In addition, dNP2-dTomato was signiﬁcantly
co-localized with inﬁltrated CD4 T cells when the brain
inﬂammation was occurred by MOG35–55
immunization,
suggesting that dNP2 can deliver its cargo protein not only into
the CNS resident cells but also into the inﬁltrated T cells. We also
observed that dNP2 could deliver a protein with high efﬁciency in
human PBMCs, while TAT shows marginal efﬁciency suggesting
that dNP2 may be suitable for clinical purposes in humans.

We also found that among the mixed cell population of
PBMCs, phagocytic cells, such as macrophages and dendritic
cells, were more likely than lymphocytes to take up CPP-cargo
proteins, suggesting that heterogeneity in CPP delivery efﬁciency
among the various cell types. In addition, we observed that the

green ﬂuorescent signal present

injected mice showed co-localization in mostly F4/80-positive
macrophage cells and some of CD4-positive cells, while co-
localization

The mechanisms of cellular uptake of CPPs that have been
studied involve lipid raft-mediated endocytosis35, clathrin-mediated
endocytosis33 and macropinocytosis53 after interaction with heparan
sulphate on cell surfaces54. We found that dNP2-recombinant
proteins also utilize lipid raft-mediated endocytosis following
heparan sulphate interaction, while a short dNP2 peptide alone
seems
endocytic pathways.
In addition, we conﬁrmed that the dNP2-EGFP protein could
also be more efﬁciently delivered into human umbilical vascular
endothelial cells (HUVEC cells) than TAT-EGFP (Supplementary
Fig. 12). This ﬁnding suggests that
the in vivo intracellular
localization of
a ﬂuorescent protein following intravenous
administration could be mediated by interactions with vascular
endothelial cells, which might subsequently induce adsorptive-
mediated transcytosis in the tissues. The luminal endothelial cell
surfaces of the BBB have an overall negative charge with high
expression of heparan sulphate proteoglycans55. Consequently,
possible brain tissue delivery through the BBB could require an
initial interaction with heparan sulphate proteoglycan to stimulate
endocytosis by endothelial cells, followed by transport into the inner
tissue region where astrocytes, neuronal cells and microglial cells
accumulate. To understand the potent delivery efﬁciency of dNP2,
we analysed and predicted the three-dimensional (3D) structures of
dNP2 using I-TASSER, which is widely used online-based
programme56,57. The predicted 3D-structure of dNP2 possesses
two separate a-helical regions linked by a potentially ﬂexible hinge
region, whereas the other CPPs contain only a single, linear a-helical
region (Supplementary Fig. 13). These structural characteristics may
enable increased interactions between dNP2 and heparin sulphate
molecules on cells, such as luminal endothelial cells.

To further conﬁrm the brain tissue localization of dNP2
proteins are not mediated by circulating lymphocytes, we
demonstrated the brain imaging studies with recombination
activating gene 1 knockout (RAG1  /  ) mice, which have no
mature circulating T or B cells, injected with the dNP2-dTomato
protein that showed results identical to those of wild-type mice
(Supplementary Fig. 14). This suggests that the brain tissue
localization of the dNP2-dTomato protein is not dependent on
circulating immune cells. Rather, it could be directly absorbed by
endothelial cells and then subsequently localized into brain tissue.
We attempted various proteins with different molecular weight to
evaluate possible size limitations for delivery of proteins into
brain tissue. We found that chemically conjugated dNP2-human
serum albumin (65 kDa) or dNP2-b-gal (120 kDa) protein could
be successfully delivered into brain tissue through blood vessels
(Supplementary Fig. 15). Consequently, there seems to be no
strict size limitation on transportation into the brain by dNP2,
which demonstrate its application potency.

Since

In 1993,

early 1990s, various disease-modifying drugs
(DMDs), other than corticosteroids, have been used to treat
multiple sclerosis.
IFN-b 1b, which can reduce
pro-inﬂammatory cytokine production from Th1 cells and inhibit
T cell migration into the CNS, was ﬁrst approved as DMD for
multiple sclerosis58. GA, a random mixture of polypeptides
composed of tyrosine, glutamate, alanine and lysine, can interfere
with antigen presentation to T cells by mimicking myelin basic
protein59. Natalizumab, a monoclonal antibody drug approved
for multiple sclerosis in 2004, can bind to a4b1 molecules on
leukocytes, resulting in inhibition of migration of cells into the
CNS60. Recently, effective and convenient oral drugs, including

Fingolimod (2010), Teriﬂunomide (2012) and dimethyl fumarate
(2013), were approved. Fingolimod can modulate the sphingosine
1-phosphate receptor on thymocytes and lymphocytes, and
can induce a reduction in inﬂammatory cell number in the
circulation and the CNS61. Teriﬂunomide inhibits the enzyme
dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, which plays a critical role in de
novo synthesis of pyrimidine, and has effects on activated and

Abatacept consists of the extracellular domain of CTLA-4 and
the Fc region of
immunoglobulin G. It can bind with B7
molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells and inhibit
T-cell activation by blocking the co-stimulatory signals to T cells
in multiple sclerosis. However, we focused on the importance of
the cytoplasmic tail of CTLA-4 in its immune regulatory function,
which was previously demonstrated in studies that overexpressed
an exon 2-deleted isoform of CTLA-4 (liCTLA-4) in murine
T cells21 and through mutation of the ligand-binding motif of
full-length CTLA-4 (ref. 65), which abolished B7-binding activity.
In addition, liCTLA-4 overexpression signiﬁcantly inhibited the
development of type 1 diabetes by regulating T-cell activation and
proliferation66,67. Our results using the cytoplasmic domain of
CTLA-4 are in agreement with studies of
liCTLA-4, which
exhibits immune regulatory functions in transgenic NOD mice
independent of B7 binding. We similarly elucidated the function
of a B7 independent form of CTLA-4 (ctCTLA-4) that encodes
only a part of exon 4 of the Ctla-4 gene. Other recent studies have
demonstrated that 1/4CTLA-4, another isoform of CTLA-4 that
genetically resembles ctCTLA-4, enhances T-cell activation and
promotes autoimmunity68,69. However, the alternative splicing of
1/4CTLA-4 induces frame-shifts that produce a completely
different amino acid sequence than ctCTLA-4 (refs 69,70).
dNP2-ctCTLA-4 inhibited T-cell
activation and displayed
potent therapeutic effects in an autoimmune encephalomyelitis
model, suggesting that the levels of the CTLA-4 cytoplasmic
domain in T cells are important for its function. Although dNP2-
ctCTLA-4 could be delivered into macrophages and dendritic
cells, there was no signiﬁcant alteration of inﬂammatory cytokine
production by Toll-like receptor ligand stimulation in those cells,
while it could successfully inhibit IL-2 or IFN-g production by
activated CD4 and CD8 T cells (Supplementary Fig. 16).
This suggests that the inhibitory mechanism on EAE is not
mediated by suppression of innate immune cells, but rather
through inhibiting effector T-cell functions. Importantly, our
in vivo experiments demonstrate that dNP2-ctCTLA-4 treatment
ameliorated clinical symptoms, even when administration was
initiated after tail paralysis. This suggests that the inhibition of
effector T-cell functions by dNP2-ctCTLA-4 could modulate the
progression of disease symptoms or enhances recovery without
signiﬁcant in vivo toxicity (Supplementary Fig. 7).

Taken together, our

study clearly demonstrates

that a
novel and potent CNS-permeable peptide, dNP2, can deliver
macromolecules, such as proteins, into the brain and spinal cord.
New therapies based on the use of dNP2 to deliver ctCTLA-4
into CNS-inﬁltrating T cells could be effective in regulating
multiple sclerosis. Future studies will focus on optimizing the
functional sequence of dNP2-ctCTLA-4 to increase its efﬁciency
and stability.

Methods
Puriﬁcation of recombinant proteins. CPP-conjugated ﬂuorescent proteins were
puriﬁed using bacterial systems. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) Star pLysS were trans-
formed with pRSET-b plasmids encoding CPP-conjugated ﬂuorescent proteins and
incubated in 50 ml of Luria-Bertani broth containing ampicillin for 12 h at 37 °C.
The cultures were then transferred into 500 ml of fresh Luria-Bertani medium and
incubated at 37 °C for another 1–2 h until the optical density at 600 nm (OD600 nm)
reached 0.4–0.6, after which 1 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside was added.
The cells were subsequently incubated overnight at 20 °C with shaking at 150 r.p.m.
(for ﬂuorescent proteins) or for 5 h at 37 °C and 200 r.p.m. (for ctCTLA-4 proteins).
The cells were then harvested by ultra-centrifugation at 6,000 r.p.m. for 20 min at
4 °C and resuspended in native lysis buffer (10 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM
NaH2PO4, pH 8.0) or 6 M urea lysis buffer and sonicated using a Vibra-cell
VCX-130 ultrasonic processor (Sonics and Materials Inc., Newton, CT). The
supernatants were ﬁltered through 0.45-mm cellulose nitrate syringe ﬁlters. The
6-His-tagged proteins were puriﬁed via Ni-NTA afﬁnity chromatography (Qiagen)
and desalted using a PD-10 Sephadex G-25 column (GE Healthcare). To obtain
highly puriﬁed proteins, an additional ion-exchange protein puriﬁcation step was
performed using SP Sepharose High Performance (GE Healthcare), followed again
by desalting on a PD-10 Sephadex G-25 column. Protein concentrations were
measured using the Bradford assay.

Cell lines and cell culture. Jurkat (human leukaemia cells) cells were purchased
from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in Roswell
Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics. HeLa (human cervix
epithelial carcinoma cells) cells were purchased from the ATCC and cultured in
Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s media with GlutaMAX supplemented with 10% FBS and
1% penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5%
CO2 incubator. All of the above reagents were purchased from Thermo Scientiﬁc
Hyclone.

Mice. Male or female C57BL/6 mice, 6–8 weeks old, were obtained from Orient
Bio (Daejeon, Korea). The mice were housed and maintained in a speciﬁc
pathogen-free facility at Hanyang University under controlled conditions with
constant temperature (21±1 °C), humidity (50±5%), and a 12 h light/dark cycle
with regular chow and autoclaved water. All animal protocols used in this study
were approved by the Hanyang Animal Care and Use Committee.

In vitro delivery efﬁciency of dNP2. Jurkat T cells were cultured in 24-well plates
at 5.0 105 cells per well in RPMI 1640 media. After the cells were seeded, each
protein was added for the indicated times. Following incubation, the cells were
harvested and washed three times with PBS. Intracellular ﬂuorescence was analysed
on a ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) Canto II ﬂow cytometer (BD
Bioscience), and the data were analysed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.). The
spleens from 6-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were placed in 60 15 mm cell
culture dishes containing 3 ml of PBS. Single-cell suspensions were physically
generated using a 0.45-mm pore-cell strainer and centrifuged after the addition of
10 ml fresh PBS. Red blood cells were lysed in Ammonium-Chloride-Potassium
(ACK) buffer (0.15 M NH4Cl, 10 mM KHCO3, 1 mM EDTA-2Na, pH 7.2). Of all,
1.0 106 splenocytes per well were seeded and the delivery efﬁciencies of CPP-
proteins were analysed. The cells were subdivided into various cell types by staining
with 1/800 diluted anti-mouse CD4-PerCP-Cy5.5 (#45-0042) and anti-mouse
CD19-PE-Cy7 (#25-0193) or anti-mouse F4/80 PerCP-Cy5.5 (#45-4,801), anti-
mouse MHCII-PE (#12-5,322-81), anti-mouse CD11b-PE-Cy7 (#25-0112) and
anti-mouse CD11c-APC (#17-0114) FACS antibodies. The antibodies were pur-
chased from eBioscience.

In vitro toxicity assay. The viability of the cells was measured via water-soluble
tetrazolium-8 based cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8, Dojindo). A total of 5.0 103
HeLa cells were seeded in 96-well plate and then treated with 10, 30, 50 or 100 mM
TAT-, dTAT-, NP2-, dNP2-EGFP or PBS for 24 h. After incubation, the cells were
washed with PBS and further incubated with CCK-8 solution for 2 h. The optical
density values were then analysed by plate reader at 450 nm (Bio-Rad).

Intracellular localization of dNP2. HeLa cells were seeded in six-well plates at
1.0 106 cells per well in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s media and incubated
overnight. The HeLa cells were then treated with CPP-EGFPs or -dTomatos
(20 mM) for 2 h at 37 °C. Following incubation, the medium was exchanged, and
the cells were washed three times with PBS. The cells were ﬁxed in 4% paraf-
ormaldehyde and washed three times with PBS. Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen) was
also added to stain nuclei, followed by three washes with PBS. Cells were then
mounted with mounting media (Sigma-Aldrich). The intracellular localization of
EGFP ﬂuorescence was observed using a DeltaVision imaging system (Applied
Precision) and the intracellular localization of dTomato ﬂuorescence was observed
using a confocal microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc.).

Isolation of human PBMC and in vitro delivery of dNP2. The protocol described
here was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Hanyang University.
Human blood samples were obtained from healthy donors and blood lymphocytes
were isolated by density centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare).
The isolated lymphocytes were seeded 1.0 106 cells per well and the delivery
efﬁciencies of CPP-proteins were analysed. The cells were further stained with
1/800 diluted anti-human CD4-PE-Cy7 (#25-0049), anti-human CD19-APC
(#17-0199), anti-human CD11b-PE-Cy7 (#25-0118) or anti-human CD11c-APC
(#17-0116) FACS antibodies purchased from eBioscience.

Live imaging of primary CD4þ T cells. 6-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were
euthanized, and CD4þ T cells were isolated from spleens and lymph nodes using a
CD4þ T cell negative selection kit (StemCell Technologies, INC). Isolated CD4þ
T cells in RPMI media were seeded on anti-CD44 antibody-coated glass coverslips
mounted in Chamlide chambers. The protein solution was then added to the
chamber, and time-lapse imaging was initiated. Differential interference contrast
(DIC) and GFP images were recorded at 5-min intervals for 2 h. The acquired time-
lapse images were analysed using MetaMorph or ImageJ software 1.48v.

Delivery mechanisms of dNP2. Isolated splenocytes from 6-week-old female
C57BL/6 mice were incubated in the presence of CPP proteins or peptides for 1 h at
various temperatures (4, 25 or 37 °C). The splenocytes or HeLa cells were
pre-treated with heparin (0, 10, 20 or 50 mg ml  1), MbCD (0, 3, or 5 mM),
chlorpromazine (0, 10 or 30 mM) or amiloride (0, 1, 2 or 5 mM) for 30 min at 37 °C,
before being treated with CPP-proteins or -peptides and additionally incubated
with CPP proteins or peptides for 1 h at 37 °C. All cells were trypsinized (trypsin,
Thermo Scientiﬁc Hyclone) and washed with FACS buffer (PBS containing 10%
FBS, 5% sodium azide and 1% EDTA). Heparin, MbCD, chlorpromazine and
amiloride were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Live imaging using multi-photon microscopy. For in vivo multi-photon imaging
of the brain, 8-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (23–25 g) were subjected to surgery to
introduce an observation window in the skull. Animals were anaesthetised via
isoﬂurane inhalation and maintained at body temperature (37–38 °C) using a
homoeothermic heating pad system controlled by a rectal probe. Isoﬂurane levels
were set at 3% to induce anaesthesia and were maintained at 1.5% during cranial
window surgery or multi-photon imaging. The animals were closely monitored
throughout the entire procedure to ensure physiological health. All surgical pro-
cedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC) of Sungkyunkwan University. Animals were ﬁxed in a stereotaxic frame
(David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA), and a round cranial window with a
diameter of 3 mm was created on the right hemisphere, centred at ML, þ 2.5 mm,
AP,   1.5 mm. After craniotomy, a customized chamber plate (Narishige Inc.,
Tokyo, Japan) with a 5-mm observation hole was placed on the opened craniotomy
area and ﬁxed with dental resin. The cranial window was then ﬁlled with sterilized
artiﬁcial cerebrospinal ﬂuid (125 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 25 mM NaHCO3,
1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4, 10 mM glucose, pH 7.4) and
covered with a 7-mm coverslip. The cranial window was sealed with cyanoacrylic
glue, and the animals were then placed in a head-ﬁxing apparatus (MAG-1,
Narishige Inc.) for multi-photon microscopy (TCS SP8 MP, Leica Microsystems
CMS GmbH). Excitation was performed using a 900-nm Ti:Sapphire laser
(Chameleon Vision II, Coherent Inc.), and the emitted ﬂuorescent signal was
detected on a hybrid detector through a 585/40 band-pass ﬁlter cube. To track the
delivery of the carrier peptide into the brain tissue, 3D z-stack images were
obtained with a 20-min time interval for 2 h following the injection of the carrier
peptide via the tail vein (2.5 mg per animal). The imaged brain size was
354.29 354.29 mm2 (1024 1024 pixels) and was acquired using a 25 water-
immersion objective lens (N.A. 0.95). The imaging depth was approximately
450–500 mm from the brain surface, with a resolution of 1 mm. Following
acquisition, the images were analysed using LAS AF 3.2.0 (Leica Microsystems
CMS GmbH) and Imaris 7.7.2 (Bitplane) software.

Immunoﬂuorescence. 6-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally
injected with 5 mg of dNP2-dTomato or control CPP-dTomato proteins to analyze
the systemic delivery efﬁciency of dNP2-dTomato. The mice were killed 2 h after
injection. The tissues were then harvested, washed with PBS and ﬁxed with 4%
paraformaldehyde. All harvested tissues were frozen using O.C.T. compound
(WAKO Chemical). The frozen blocks were cut into 6-mm-thick slices using a
cryostat (Thermo Scientiﬁc) and examined via ﬂuorescence microscopy (Leica
Microsystems). For the analysis of brain and spinal cord tissues in EAE-induced
mice, 1 h after intravenous injection of 2.5 mg dNP2-dTomato, the animals were
euthanized and perfused transcardially with 15 ml of PBS, followed by 15 ml of 4%
paraformaldehyde. The brain tissue was removed and washed with PBS. The tissue
was then post-ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature and
cryoprotected in 30% sucrose for 24 h at 4 °C. Brain tissues were frozen
using O.C.T. compound (WAKO Chemical). The frozen blocks were cut into
40-mm-thick slices using a cryostat (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Logan, UT). Sections were
incubated in cold acetone for 30 min at   20 °C and then washed with PBS for
30 min at room temperature. Washed samples were incubated with

permeabilization buffer (0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 10 min and blocking buffer
(3% BSA, 0.1% Tween-20) for another 20 min. Primary antibody staining was
performed overnight using 1/100 diluted anti-mouse CD4-FITC (eBioscience,
#11-0041), 1/100 diluted anti-mouse GFAP (Millipore, #AB5804), 1/100 diluted
anti-mouse Iba-1 (WAKO chemical, #019-19741) or 1/100 diluted anti-mouse
NeuN (Abcam, #104224). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 dye (Invitrogen)
or DAPI (Vector Laboratory) following antibody binding. All section samples were
analysed by confocal microscopy (TCS SP8, Leica Microsystems CMS GmbH).

EAE induction. 7-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were purchased from DBL. The
protocol described here was approved by the animal experimentation ethics
committee of Hanyang University. EAE was induced by subcutaneous immuni-
zation with 100 mg of MOG35–55 peptide (MEVGWYRSPFSRVVHLYRNGK) in
Freund’s adjuvant emulsion (adjuvant-incomplete Freund and Mycobacterium
tuberculosis H37Ra at 4 mg per ml, BD Difco). The total subcutaneously injected
emulsion volume was 200 ml. At 0 h and 48 h after immunization, mice were
intraperitoneally treated with 200 ng of pertussis toxin (List Biological Laboratories
Inc.). Animals were scored daily for signs of clinical disease. Each dose of protein
diluted in 100 ml of PBS or fresh PBS alone was injected intraperitoneally. Mice
were euthanized at the end of the experiments, and lymphocytes in the CNS were
isolated by Percoll (GE Healthcare) density-gradient centrifugation. The surface of
the isolated lymphocytes was stained with 1/800 diluted anti-mouse CD4
PerCP-Cy5.5 antibody (eBioscience, #45-0042). The lymphocytes were also stained
with 1/400 diluted anti-mouse IFN-g-FITC (eBioscience, #13-7,311) and 1/100
diluted IL-17A-APC antibodies (eBioscience, #17-7,177) using the Fixation/Per-
meabilization concentrate and diluent kit (eBioscience). The cells were analysed
using a FACSCanto ﬂow cytometer and FlowJo software. For histologic analysis,
parafﬁn blocks of spinal cord tissues were deparafﬁnized and immersed in Luxol
fast blue. For combination staining, hematoxylin and eosin was used (Dako). The
inﬁltrated cells in the white matter region of spinal cord tissues were counted using
Image J software 1.48v.

In vivo toxicity assays. Three groups of 7-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were
repetitively injected with PBS, 5 mg per kg of dNP2-dTomato or dNP2-ctCTLA-4,
respectively, every other day for 14 days. The weight changes of the mice were daily
monitored. At day 15, the mice were sacriﬁced and the morphologies of the spleen,
liver and brain were carefully observed. The cytotoxicity of each protein against
splenocytes and thymocytes was analysed using an Annexin V and 7-AAD staining
kit (BD bioscience). The percentages of naive CD4 T cells in lymph nodes and
spleen were analysed with isolated lymphocytes from each tissue after staining with
1/800 diluted anti-mouse CD4-PerCP-Cy5.5 (#45-0042), anti-mouse CD62L-FITC
(#11-0621) and anti-mouse CD44-PE (#12-0441) FACS antibodies purchased from
eBioscience. Liver toxicity of the proteins was analysed using an alanine amino-
transferase activity assay kit (BioVision) and an aspartate aminotransferase activity
assay kit (BioVision).

Statistics. The data were analysed using two-tailed Student’s t-tests. P values
o0.05 were considered signiﬁcant.
