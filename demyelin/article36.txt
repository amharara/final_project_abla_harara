Abstract

Objectives: Misfolding of key disease proteins to an insoluble state is associated
with most neurodegenerative conditions, such as prion, Parkinson, and Alzhei-
mer’s diseases. In this work, and by studying animal models of multiple sclero-
sis, we asked whether this is also the case for myelin basic protein (MBP) in
the late and neurodegenerative phases of demyelinating diseases. Methods: To
this effect, we tested whether MBP, an essential myelin component, present
prion-like properties in animal models of MS, as is the case for Cuprizone-
induced chronic demyelination or chronic phases of Experimental Autoimmune
Encephalomyelitis (EAE). Results: We show here that while total levels of MBP
were not reduced following extensive demyelination, part of these molecules
accumulated thereafter as aggregates inside oligodendrocytes or around neuro-
nal cells. In chronic EAE, MBP precipitated concomitantly with Tau, a marker
of diverse neurodegenerative conditions, including MS. Most important, analy-
sis of fractions from Triton X-100 ﬂoatation gradients suggest that the lipid
composition of brain membranes in chronic EAE differs signiﬁcantly from that
of na€ıve mice, an effect which may relate to oxidative insults and subsequently
prevent the appropriate insertion and compaction of new MBP in the myelin
sheath, thereby causing its misfolding and aggregation. Interpretation: Prion-
like aggregation of MBP following chronic demyelination may result from an
aberrant lipid composition accompanying this pathological status. Such aggre-
gation of MBP may contribute to neuronal damage that occurs in the progres-
sive phase of MS.

Introduction

Perturbation of the myelin sheath, or demyelination, leads
to several severe brain diseases, including multiple sclero-
sis (MS).1 While different mechanisms, including autoim-
mune pathways may lead to demyelination and its clinical
consequences,2 recent evidence also suggests that a signiﬁ-
cant part of the neurological damage in MS may be of
neurodegenerative nature.3–5 In recent years, a variety of
neurodegenerative diseases has been associated with the
accumulation of misfolded key disease proteins.6–8 This
effect, ﬁrst established for PrPSc in prion diseases,9 was
next expanded to proteins associated with other brain
conditions such as A-beta for Alzheimer’s disease (AD),
a-synuclein for Parkinson’s disease, phosphorylated Tau
for tauopathies and other diseases,10–13 and several others.
Most of these proteins are natively unstructured when
prepared as monomers in vitro, but form b-sheath-rich
aggregates when incubated at high concentrations.13,14

Myelin basic protein (MBP) is an indispensable protein
of myelinated axons.1 The sequence of MBP predicts the
formation of an intrinsically disordered protein carrying a
large positive charge, which allows for countless protein
surface interactions.15 This property is speciﬁc for MBP
and is not recognized in other abundant myelin proteins,
such as myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) or
Myelin proteolipid protein (PLP).1 To preclude MBP
from nonspeciﬁc binding to molecules, MBP mRNA
assembles
termed
“granules” which are targeted into oligodendrocyte exten-
sions,1 and translated in-situ. Consequent MBP-mem-
brane interactions rely on an accurate stoichiometrical
balance between the basic residues of MBP and the acidic
headgroups of the lipid bilayer components, as well as on
copper ions inducing the compaction of the MBP struc-
ture.16 This suggests that reduced myelin stability may
relate to changes in levels of diverse myelin components,
including designated lipids and their oxidized products,17

(EAE),

In this work, we tested in mouse models of demyelina-
tion whether MBP can present in aggregated forms, and
whether such effect may relate to changes in myelin com-
ponents.18
In one model, chronic demyelination was
induced by Cuprizone, an established copper chelator.19
Cuprizone administration to na€ıve mice may promote the
removal of copper ions from MBP and thereby generate
loss of myelin compaction.16 In the Experimental Auto-
immune Encephalomyelitis model
induced by
immunization of na€ıve C57BL/6 mice with a peptide form
MOG,20 mice suffer from acute paralytic neurological dis-
ease ~10 days after the immunization, which remits par-
tially while leaving the mice with a disability associated
injury.21 Our
with chronic demyelination and axonal
results show that MBP can precipitate and aggregate in
brains affected by chronic forms of demyelination and
that aggregation of MBP occurred concomitant with
accumulation of insoluble and phosphorylated Tau. Of
special note, ﬂotation experiments demonstrated that the
membrane microenvironment of PrPC, an established raft
protein,22,23 is less resistant to solubilization by Triton X-
100 during chronic EAE, suggesting a reduction in choles-
terol and glycosphingolipids levels, as shown for MS.24,25
Indeed, depletion of cholesterol from myelin membranes
may induce the formation of abnormal myelin.26 These
aberrant
components may
explain the exit of MBP form the demyelinating sheath
and its subsequent aggregation.27

Floatation experiments

Flotation of detergent insoluble complexes was performed
as described previously.31 In brief, mouse brains were
homogenized 1:10 wt/vol in an ice-cold buffer containing
150 mmol/L sodium chloride, 25 mmol/L TRIS hydro-
chloride (pH 7.5), 5 mmol/L EDTA (Ethylenediaminete-
traacetic acid), and 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO). Insoluble particles were spun down and the
lysate was loaded at the bottom of ultracentrifuge tubes
(TLS-55; Beckman Instruments, Inc, Fullerton, CA). An
equal volume of ice-cold Nycodenz (Biological Industries,
Beit Haemek, Israel), 70%,
in TNE (25 mmol/L TRIS
hydrochloride [pH 7.5], 150 mmol/L sodium chloride, and
5 mmol/L EDTA) was added and mixed with the lysate.
An 8% to 35% Nycodenz linear step gradient in TNE was
then overlaid above the lysate (200 mL each of 35%, 25%,
22.5%, 20%, 18%, 15%, 12%, and 8% Nycodenz). The
tubes were spun at 55,000 rpm for 4 h at 4°C in a TLS-55
rotor (200,000 g). Fractions were collected from the top to
the bottom of the tube. Each fraction was applied to
sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotted with a-PrP polyclonal
antibody RTC, as well as with a a-MBP antibody.

respectively) and 10-weeks of Cuprizone treatment. In
some experiments, sections were stained with Luxol fast

lination. In consecutive sections,

Results

Cuprizone administration to mice induced
intracellular accumulation of MBP in
oligodendrocytes

Six-month-old mice (C57BL/6, 9 mice per group) were
treated with Cuprizone for 10 weeks
(see Methods)
before they were sacriﬁced and their brains compared to
control untreated mice for demyelination parameters.
Myelination status of treated and untreated brains was
ﬁrst
examined in Parafﬁn-embedded brain sections,
stained with LFB, a copper phthalocyanine dye that is
soluble in alcohol and is attracted to bases found in the
the myelin sheath.32 Cuprizone-treated
lipoproteins of
mice exhibited extensive demyelination, particularly in
the corpus callosum, as depicted by the reduced levels of
LFB staining in the treated versus the control samples
(Fig. 1A and B). While immunoﬂuorescent staining with
an a-MBP body indicated that
the levels of MBP in
brains of Cuprizone-treated mice (Fig. 1E and F) were
mostly preserved, the staining pattern was different from
that of untreated brains (Fig. 1C and D). In control mice,

MBP was, as expected,
localized in the oligodendrocyte
extension, while in Cuprizone-treated mice MBP was
present not only in cell extensions, but also in a peri-
nuclear distribution (Fig. 1E and F). This abnormal
localization is contrary to the notion that MBP mRNA is
usually translated only in oligodendrocyte
extension
forming axonal myelin.1 The pathologic concentration of
MBP in Cuprizone-demyelinated brains suggested that
the protein may be aggregated in a form that prevents its
degradation following demyelination. To test this possi-
bility, we extracted brain homogenates of
treated and
untreated brains with Sarkosyl, and subsequently sepa-
rated supernatants and pellets after ultracentrifugation.
As positive controls for brain samples comprising a key
disease aggregated protein, we also extracted by the same
method homogenates of prion-infected brains, both from
a transmissible36 and for a genetic TgMHu2ME199K
model.37 The normal PrP protein is present in all brains
as a detergent soluble membrane protein (PrPC). How-
ever,
in prion affected brains an aberrantly aggregated
form, PrPSc, constituting the key component and marker
of prions and their diseases,
is detected in pellets. All
samples (pellets and supernatants) of the different experi-
mental groups were immunoblotted with an a-MBP and
an a-PrP antibody.

Figure 2 shows the results of these experiments. As
expected, while PrPC was detected in all sarkosyl soluble
brain samples, its aggregated isoforms were present only
in the pellets of the prion affected mice, both in the
transmissible (Rocky mountains laboratory strain) and in
the genetic TgMHu2ME199K model (Fig. 2A). Respec-
tively, only the pellet of the Cuprizone mice brains pre-
sented pelletable MBP (Fig. 2B). In combination with the
results described in Figure 1, we may conclude that intra-
cellular MBP in oligodendrocytes of Cuprizone-treated
mice is accumulated in an aggregated–insoluble form.

MBP aggregation in chronic EAE

We next tested the biochemical properties of MBP in
mice affected with the most popular model of demyelin-
ation, EAE.20 To this effect, na€ıve mice were immunized
with a MOG35–55 peptide (see Methods) resulting in an
acute neurological paralytic disease, followed by partial
remission and chronic phase (Fig. 3A).38 In the present
experiments, mice were sacriﬁced either at the end of
the acute phase (15 days) or 100 days thereafter in the
chronic state (see arrows
in Fig. 3A). Brain samples
from na€ıve, acute, and chronic EAE mice were homoge-
nized in the presence of Sarkosyl, as described above for
the Cuprizone mice, and following ultracentrifugation,
tested for the levels of pelletable MBP accumulation as
well as its resistance to PK digestion. Resistance to pro-

with an a-MBP and then with an a-PrP antibody. The
ﬁgure shows that only PrPSc in the brains of scrapie-
infected mice was resistant
to PK digestion in these
experiments, whereas aggregated MBP in chronic EAE
brains was PK sensitive, as is the case for some of the
prion pathological isoforms.40

Aggregated MBP binds to neuronal cells

Next, brain sections from na€ıve mice, as well as from
those suffering from acute and chronic EAE were sub-
jected to immunohistochemistry with an a-MBP anti-
body. Figure 4 shows extensive MBP immunostaining in
cerebellar white matter of all mice. However, in chronic
EAE sections MBP accumulated also around neuronal
cells, such as Purkinje cells, as can be seen in sections Fig-
ure 4E and F. Indeed, it was recently shown that MBP
binding may induce neuron-speciﬁc toxicity by direct

damaging the neuronal plasma membrane integrity.41
Consistent with this, our results indicate that following
demyelination, new MBP aggregates may damage neuro-
nal cells by a prion-like mechanism.42

Aggregated tau accumulates in chronic EAE
concomitant with MBP

To look for additional proteins that may aggregate in the
brains of chronic EAE mice, we subjected sarkosyl pellets
(as above) of brain homogenates from na€ıve, acute, and
chronic EAE mice to SDS-PAGE and subsequently stained
the gels with coomassie blue. Figure 5A shows the proﬁle
of bands appearing in acute and chronic EAE brains. Bands
speciﬁc for EAE samples were excised from the gels and
subjected to novel mass spectrometry examination (MS –
MS) (see Methods). Some of the identiﬁed proteins are
listed in Figure 5B. Of special note is the accumulation of

the Tau protein in the nonsoluble fraction of chronic EAE.
Tau is a glial and neuronal43 cytoskeletal protein involved
in microtubule assembly and stabilization, which accumu-
lates in several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alz-
heimer’s and human prion diseases in an hyperphospho-
rylated and aggregated form.44–46 Accumulation of
insoluble Tau is associated with disease progression also in
MS and in EAE.47,48 To assess the mass spectrometry
results, we immunoblotted total brain homogenates, as well
as soluble and nonsoluble fractions with an antibody
against phosphorylated Tau. Figure 5C shows that while
total and soluble Tau levels were present at similar levels in
all samples, insoluble Tau was mostly present in chronic
EAE, as is the case for the insoluble MBP. These results are
consistent with the notion that insoluble MBP may be a

marker of the neurodegenerative stage in demyelinating
diseases, as is the case for Tau.

Chronic EAE brains may differ in their lipid
composition from na€ıve brains
Lipid–protein interactions are pivotal for myelin mainte-
nance, since they regulate the molecular organization
within the myelin sheath.18 Therefore, alteration in correl-
ative lipid levels may well affect myelin stability and func-
tion, as well as the capability of inserting myelin proteins
such as MBP to the normally compacting myelin. Indeed,
reduction in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids
levels
interferes with oligodendrocyte differentiation and myeli-
nation.25,26 To test the stability of lipid composition in

during chronic demyelinating conditions, similarly to key
proteins in well-established neurodegenerative diseases.13
While in these diseases, and particularly in prion diseases
featuring the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc, such aggrega-
tion occurs concomitantly with protein oxidation and
aberrant conformational changes,53 MBP misfolding to an
insoluble condition may be secondary to alterations in lev-
els of myelin components responsible for the compaction
of MBP between the myelin sheaths.16,26 Indeed, in the
Cuprizone model of demyelination, this copper chelator
may reduce the levels of copper ions required for MBP
compaction and thereby promote its aggregation outside
the membrane.19 In the brains of mice suffering from
chronic EAE, it can be the reduced levels of cholesterol
and other lipids which may preclude the entrance of MBP
to its appropriate location in the myelin sheath and induce
its aggregation outside the membrane. Outside the mem-
brane, aggregated MBP may damage neighboring neu-
rons,41 promoting further neurodegeneration. It remains
to be established whether changes in lipid composition
result or encourage the demyelinating process.

In addition to key protein misfolding and aggregation,
oxidative stress is also a common factor in both neurode-
conditions and chronic demyelination.54,55
generative
Indeed, most of the aggregated key proteins in neurode-
generative conditions are oxidized in some of their resi-
dues, as is the case for Met residues in PrPSc.53,56 While we
have no knowledge at this point about direct oxidation of
MBP, oxidation of other brain proteins was shown to
occur both in MS and in EAE.57 Importantly, it was shown
convincingly that lipids in MS plaques are oxidized, as
demonstrated by immunostaining with an antibody against
oxidized phospholipids.54 In addition, several studies have
demonstrated a signiﬁcant increase in lipid peroxidation
products in brain, plasma, and cerebrospinal ﬂuid of MS
patients. Since oxidized lipoproteins are neurotoxic and
have pro-inﬂammatory properties,
lipid peroxidation
products could be involved in demyelination and axonal
injury in MS.17,58 The EO6 antibody (for oxidized lipids)54
also reacts extensively with brain slices from a mouse
model of genetic prion disease,59 suggesting that lipid oxi-
dation may be a general feature of neurodegeneration.
Oxidation of lipids in the myelin sheath and other mem-
branes may also contribute to the change in lipid composi-
tion that generates less stable rafts, thereby disturbing the
location of their associated proteins and even their func-
tion. This may promote the instability of MBP within the
membrane and its aggregation.

We conclude that due to the complex interactions of
MBP with other myelin components, small alterations in
lipid composition/oxidation or copper concentration may
affect the afﬁnity of MBP to the myelin membrane.60,61
Next, decompacted forms of MBP released from the mye-

from the

the EAE affected brains, we subjected Triton X-100
extracted brain homogenates of na€ıve, acute, and chronic
EAE brains to Nicodentz ﬂoatation gradients.31 Under
these conditions, Triton X-100 detergent-resistant mem-
branes (DRMs) ﬂoat to upper fractions together with
their associated proteins. For example, PrPC, a well-estab-
lished DRM or raft protein may be found in the ﬂoating
fractions.23 MBP does not normally ﬂoat in Triton X-100
gradients,49 but does show afﬁnity to Raft lipids in other
detergent systems.49,50 Following ultracentrifugation, the
gradient fractions were immunoblotted ﬁrst for PrP and
then for MBP. Figure 6 shows that while PrP ﬂoats to the
lighter gradient fractions in the na€ıve brains, and some-
what less so in acute EAE brains, in the chronic state the
location of PrP changed dramatically to denser fractions
of the gradient, indicating altered levels of cholesterol and
glycosphingolipids, the main DRM components. Indeed,
similar results for PrP were obtained when na€ıve mem-
branes were extracted with methyl-b-cyclodextrin (not
shown), a reagent that depletes cholesterol from mem-
branes.51,52 Also MBP was pushed to denser fractions of
the gradient in chronic EAE brain extracts,
indicating
weaker association of the myelin protein with DRM frac-
tions. The changes in lipid composition of chronic EAE
brain membranes, which origin is not totally understood,
may well disrupt MBP insertion and compaction in mye-
lin sheaths and subsequently promote its aggregation.

Discussion

We have shown in this work that MBP, a main component
of the myelin membrane, may aggregate and precipitate

lin sheath may misfold into new entities, which may sub-
sequently cause additional damage to neuronal cells. Mis-
folded and basically charged MBP forms may aggregate
with lipid structures or complex with negative GAGs,
(Glycosaminoglycans) for example,
in autophagic lyso-
somes.18,62 In summary, we suggest a mechanistic model
for progressive neurodegeneration in MS, in which prion-
like aggregated MBP formed during demyelination may
cause neuronal toxicity and induce further demyelination,
eventually resulting in more misfolded MBP and more
neuronal damage. Indeed, it would be nice to test this
hypothesis in sample form human patients.
